      <p class="Firstlineindent">I am putting this book, which is mostly unimportant nonsense, into github, published from LibreOffice writer, and exported as HTML, so that others can ‘fork’ the text of the book, and add or take away as they see fit.  The book includes, in its title, the phrase ‘observations for future research’, as someone with greater resources than myself, might wish to take the time to add clearly referenced supporting research, or might like to do original research of their own kind.  They also, might refute some part of the suggestions that I make, and I provide this text for those people as well, to ease their ability to find the empirically supported ground from which to logically, and rationally refute my arguments.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Each github repository has the ability to engage in meaningful discussion regarding any issue, as well as the capacity to make ‘pull requests’ so that more detail, research or refutation etc can be merged into the original document.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">It is in the spirit of collaboration then, that I publish like this, but it is motivated, above all else, in the name of two principal ethics.  The first is that it is the basis of any properly functioning society that health be provided, free of charge, with no observable or real difference in the provision of that health to any person with utter disregard to their financial or social standing in that society.  It is an ethical pronouncement, that has not yet been comprehended by the societies of the world, properly.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Even in Britain, with its national insurance and NHS, the roots of those ‘socialist’ inventions occurred at the point of the Victorian reformist movement, so not so long ago.  </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">That Victorian movement </span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">was stimulated in no small way by the terrifying incidence of death consequent to tuberculosis and other illnesses that occurred in the mid 19</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10.826668px;vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px"> century.  Those plagues of illness themselves were stimulated, in part, by naively designed, badly planned and over confined civil architecture, despite the fact that that architecture was inspired by the best interests for workers by those who constructed them. </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Civil architecture, like all other things, is a process that takes some time to mature past the initial mistakes.  In the early part of the 20</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10.826668px;vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px"> century, the announcement of the ‘germ theory’ of illness, occurred almost simultaneous to the terrible conditions of the first world war, popularising as a consequence the terrifying possibility that we are surrounded by things that we cannot see that are out to get us.  This left the elite more than certainly wanting to have some degree of separation between themselves and the ‘grubby’ working classes when being treated.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	These misconceived preconceptions have more or less disappeared now, but we continue to be plagued by the impossible situation of providing some blend of privatised and nationalised health.  I support what I consider to be the obvious position, ‘health is priceless’.  Since there is no price great enough that can be put upon our health and the health of our nearest and dearest, a privatised health model leaves medications and staff wages increasing rapidly and massively to the point at which very few people in society can realistically afford those things.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This is what has happened with the American model of health, with health insurance being not only expensive, again rapidly reaching unobtainable amounts for the majority, but also demonstrating that many people in poverty do not have the luxury of considering their position in the future, unable to resolve their way past Maslow’ first stage in his hierarchy of needs, and in a fatalist manner, not catering for their future by taking out insurance.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, only nationalised health will survive, and so I personally support the suggestion that there should exist no privatised health, whatsoever.  As we enter an era where many of our 20<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span> century technologies have matured to the point of having attained some degree of perfection, wards being replaced with individual rooms through the use of partitioned studwork walls, is not unrealisable.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, all health should be provided free of charge.  In the case of my book, I have written it whilst on receipt of income support.  So, I propose to put this book into the open domain, free of charge, in part, to thank those who have been supporting me, indirectly, through their contributions to the state.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The second ethic, is a particularly important one.  That is that there should be no patenting of ideas.  Ideas should be openly available, free of charge, for all to use and incorporate into their intellectual development.  The fact that ideas can be patented and then bought and sold, is part and parcel of the mechanisms of some thieves who have been attacking students and using the mental hospital and mental health diagnoses and descriptions that they have ‘sculpted’ in order to steal ideas. Knowledge is power, and so they steal knowledge from individuals to support their existence, those nefarious individuals and concerns.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Aside from that, when knowledge is freely available, and with the mechanism of the internet it is easy to institute such a situation, the flow of ideas is maximised to the extent that one sees a great flow of consequences of those ideas, and society improves its lot generally.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Furthermore, the buying and selling of patents, is, effectively, the buying and selling of souls, which may sound a little exaggerated, but if one examines some idea or other, proposed by some individual, one will find that their idea is not really their idea at all.  It is a composite of many ideas preceding their own, simply a new formulation.  As the saying goes, there is no such thing as a new idea.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I publish this book under a modified form of the <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Creative Commons License</span>, which allows anyone to use this work in any form, commercial or otherwise, as long as they attribute in their published work, some reference to me, as the author of those ideas that they might be inspired by from this book.  The modification that I have made to the license, is a rigid one, hopefully written in such a way so as to be unmodifiable.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It proposes that any individual who uses the ideas in this book for some device or machine, or in any other way, does not do so in anyway that might bring harm to others, with specific reference to any form of weaponry.  In any case where some individual, individuals or group or company etc. uses the ideas in this book as weapons or in any other way that might promote harm to occur, that individual, individuals, group, or company etc., loses their rights to incorporate my ideas, and I hope that there will exist some agency that will be able to pursue the enforcement of my wish, should the situation occur in the future.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Pref<a id="a02Preface"></a>ace</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I have tried to write this book several times before.  It started out as the development of an essay that examined the neurophysiological efficacy of the process of EMDR, before becoming a rather grandiose inspection of the use of insights into materialist psychology and their use in the acquisition and maintenance of power over history.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In this attempt, I am going to focus on consciousness, in terms of the basic description of the neurophysiology, before examining how that model can provide insight into ‘abnormal’ and ‘normal’ psychology.  When I have finished I will discuss machine consciousness, before I finish with some observations about what happens when consciousness stops, amongst other things.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">At all times, I am going to try and write using short sentence structure (not my forte), and prefer pithiness over complexity.  I argue that scientists, across the course of the twentieth century, invented a language that had its own emergent rhetoric.  This rhetoric occurred as they attempted to pursue the creation of a politically neutral ‘language of science’.  What happened was that science be<span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">came </span>a ‘sacred’ or perhaps ‘secret’ impenetrable language that distanced the findings of science from the people that should know about the results: the general public.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I will not provide any citations, so if you are interested you will have to look up supporting research for yourself, or feel contented that my insights that I recount are so obvious that someone either has or will provide research to support it at some point.  In the meantime, take it all with a proverbial pinch of salt.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I provide a model at a physical level of description.  It does not deny the reality of chemical interactions, but where the more complex and less visualisable model provided by chemistry might describe some relationship with regard to the underlying co-valency of molecular bonds, I will simply say ‘stickiness’ and refer to the interaction using a higher level, tangible description; a plainer form of English, if you will. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In both cases, we might be describing the same thing, that is what is meant by levels of description – the same phenomenon is described in different ways, to different depths of analysis, with different lexicons, but nonetheless it is the same phenomenon.  This idea - ‘levels of description’, can be used to describe the many psychological schools of thought.  Jungian Analysis, Rogerian Therapy, CBT of Aaron Beck and others, Mindfulness, and Freudian psycho-analysis, all of these and many other different schools of thought employ different lexicons, exposing different aspects of the same underlying phenomena.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Nonetheless they are describing the same phenomena, human psychology just in different ways.  The first time that one can actually be certain of describing that phenomena, in a way that captures the essence of what all those other schools of psychology describe, I might suggest, is when one is describing it at the level of physiology.  There, there exist certainly observable, predictably co-varying properties that can be referred to under the greater rubric of this or that ‘condition’.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This, broadly speaking is what is referred to by the term ‘materialism’: there exists, for every mental event, a corresponding physical event.  I adhere to what is called the ‘weak’ form of this style of reasoning, in that I accept that there might be several mental events arising from the same physical state.  I am not especially studied in the philosophy of mind, so I don’t want to quibble over terms.  I will state, though, for the record, that despite my subscription to materialism, I propose that free will exists, in contrast to any suggestion of determinism.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As for consciousness, it is a state of being that can be inspected at any given moment by an external observer or the self, where in both cases it is understood to be consciousness.  A more precise definition, might suggest that is the activity of the neurons and the physiology that make the physical form of the self.  Others might suggest that consciousness can be extracted as a state, incorporating into their explanation a level of compatibility with the ‘cogito ergo sum’ supported ‘deus ex machina’ beliefs of the church, sometimes referred to as dualism.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The phenomenon of dualism can be witnessed, physically, in such observations that suggest that the body can respond to stimuli that it cannot consciously report, such observations being the basis for the work of hypnotists.  It can be explained and described within the scope of the model that is this presently presented theory of materialist psychology.  If this model cannot account for observations made in the different schools of therapeutic psychology, then it is not a valid model of consciousness.  It can be demonstrated, I hope, that the model provides novel, testable predictions regarding some phenomena.  That would allow it to pass the most rigorous of criteria of ‘good’ science.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">However, I hope that, before this model is considered in scientific terms, it will be appreciated for its ability to provide succour to those who experience psychological issues, either ‘normal’ or ‘abnormal’.  The model, which doesn’t delve into the complex and difficult to recall polysyllabic terms of chemistry, is hopefully both sufficiently easy to visualise and sufficiently accurate to be of use in allaying fears by making good and accurate predictions with regards to the outcomes of interventions. Know thyself.  Heal thyself.  Healthy self.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I think it is true that an observation can be made that states that for each person there is a different ‘model’ of health employed by each person.  So, each individual has their own model made of sometimes standard and sometimes non-standard linguistic frames of reference that co-vary with the phenomenon that they are experiencing to one degree of efficacy or another.  The model employed, that contains a set of terms that co-vary with physical phenomena, can be completely untrue, bearing no resemblance to any anatomical reality.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">All that matters for that model to be successful is that its component parts co-vary successfully with the experienced phenomena in a way that leads to successful outcomes.  In society, whatever shape that model takes, it is also important that the terms within that model are drawn from a lexicon of agreed definitions, so that an individual can communicate their condition successfully.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, the visualisable model that I am attempting to construct here, is a visualisable model that may not make perfect sense anatomically, but is one that co-varies with physical phenomenon, making consistent predictions about psychological health, based on some set of anatomical realities.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It does so in a visualisable manner, and makes, in some cases, novel predictions, that seem to be borne out by observation.  Whilst that makes it potentially fit within that definition of good ‘science’, I, most of all, would like to allow mental health conditions to be understood, and where understanding means complete transparency, with no hidden layers or component parts where charlatans can stand around, scaremongering and selling fake cures, as they do currently.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Above all, I hope to impress upon the reader, at least with regards to mental health issues, that the person experiencing those mental health issues will be viewed in a way that is consistent with the observations made by this analysis.  I want to make this model as good as I can, i.e. as successful as possible at describing real phenomenon.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Note that I use the term ‘experiencing’ mental health issues rather than ‘suffering’ since many mental health conditions are potentially life long conditions, and are replete with positive consequences, as well as negative ones.  I hope to point out, with this model, that the circumstances affecting a person, can affect any person, to help rid the historical cultural hangover of ‘being cursed by evil spirits’ that the mental health field has acquired from its long history of mystery.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I want to demonstrate that the ways in which the mental health patient is behaving is perfectly normal given the circumstances that is being experienced.  Then that person with mental health issues can be seen as a normal person, behaving normally, in difficult circumstances. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I also want this materialist model that I am constructing, to be of use to anyone who might be considering an attempt at constructing ‘artificial consciousness’.  Parts of my description of the brain, for instance, might seem of more help to students of artificial consciousness than mental health patients, but in a later section, after the description of the materialist substance of consciousness, I relate those visualised parts of the greater model, to the mental health conditions.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Should any constructed ‘artificially conscious’ person be required to demonstrate problems of function similar to humans, in order to be seen as conscious?  I will leave it a question to be debated by others.  In any case, I hope to keep this current attempt at writing this book short.  I will, however, digress in to pseudo philosophy from time to time, probably from boredom, the cause of all philosophy, I think.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As an example, if you understand the notion of fractals that repeat their shape as they grow, that shape consequent to some non-deterministic formula, maintaining the same shape at an amplified dimension, then you will find that much of our existence can be described as occurring fractally in the sense that the way in which it behaves is similar (only smaller) at lower levels of description and similar (only bigger) at higher levels of description.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I would go so far as to say that all of existence, including human cognition and social organisation can be thought of as a fractally occurring self organising system. Whilst there is perhaps no real substantial truth to this heuristic description (although I would beg to differ), one can point to the idea of trauma as surprise and see that trauma in this sense describes the outline of objects to the neurons of our senses, whilst at a super-ordinate level of description it describes how objects stand out in our memory.  In this book, I use the term ‘trauma’ as a type of perceptual phenomenon, different from the textbook definition of 'pain' or 'shock to the psyche'.  Trauma can be positive, of use to the individual, it simply means an attentional experience that stands out from the background.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">And finally, I should have written this book ten or perhaps twenty, years ago, but managed to find myself waylaid by thieves, who have been extracting the information herein to a greater or lesser degree over the last ten years.  I am left with the fear of embarrassment that all that I might say here is either a nonsense, or has been described long before, where I consider it quite novel, the thieves having delineated the insights that they have stolen from me through universities more attuned to their political position, over the course of the previous ten years.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The point of science, though, is to bring useful information into the view of some audience, I would think, and it doesn’t matter if it has been described before, just that it is described.  Ultimately, my ‘model’, is a framework to hang observations on, in order to bring them to mind, when engaging in future research.  Further research is something that I had hoped all those years ago to engage in, and something that might still happen yet.  I know that the insights, in fact all of the content of this book is speculation, and falls within some category that has a greater affinity with philosophy than empirical science.  So, I sketch out the model, and was aiming to, at a later date, engage in empirical research in order to provide support for its suggestions.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, there may or may not be support for the observations that I have made, I simply haven’t had the access to a university level library, and journals etc., and haven’t entirely wanted to put that effort in when any chance of engaging in further research is so unlikely.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What I will say, is that I prefer to live in a known world, where authentic empirical support is the minimum acceptable standard for the acceptance of any observation, and so I hope that if it is interesting to you the reader, then you will perhaps make an effort to find empirical support for the observations that I make.  Otherwise, as I will state regularly throughout this book, take it all with a pinch of salt.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 1:</span> <a id="a1TheNeuron"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">The neuron</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I’ll start small and work my way up to the bigger picture.  The neuron is the basic building block of the human self.  This might seem like a statement of the obvious, so obvious that it is a redundant statement.  However, if I currently asked a psychiatrist, they might point to what I suggest is a nonsense idea, that the neurochemicals are the basic building block, the fundament of our self.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I ought to add that if I asked a priest, he might say that the soul is the basic building block or perhaps that God is.  If I asked a witch doctor, they might suggest that tree spirits make up the mind.  One could suggest that it is ‘horses for courses’, that the definition is relative to the field of analysis, in terms of outcomes.  I must add that the definitions that the psychiatrist currently uses, are sponsored into existence by research funded by pharmaceutical companies, and is located in an ‘unknown’ and ‘unseeable’ brain.  The lack of accountability of the location of the brain provides the perfect place to allow the consequences of interventions to be discussed in courts of law, whilst that complexity of definition is the worst place imaginable for the purpose of reducing the worries of a psychologically stressed individual.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is dark, unknowable, and automatic, removing any chance of self control, encouraging the patient to relax into whatever state might be absorbing them.  That inability to incorporate self control into the psychiatric model, is disempowering.  All in all, Psychiatry, and its language and rhetoric generally, is a self powering, self defending meme, that leaves a group of establishment cronies (or they don’t get the job), able to refute the basic principles of habeas corpus.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The model that I provide here demonstrates how the brain functions.  It also illustrates that the theories that support neurochemical arguments of deficiencies of inter-synapse chemical or deficiencies of pre-cursors to that neurochemical relationship are both more likely founded in the actions of the adrenal glands.  I will suggest that that mineralocorticoid release relationship was understood before the 2nd world war, and forgotten afterwards, for some not so bizarre reason concerning the use of psychology for fraud and political advantage.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The basic building block of my model, the neuron, is a physical unit of existence that can be described as a cell.  It has cell walls and it has a nucleus, as well as trailing arms called dendrites.  I don’t intend to describe the cell in too great a measure, since I will mostly be examining the consequence of the cardiovascular hydraulics on the cell, before examining some evidence with regards to how the CNS works ‘internally’ to provide us with that rich inner life that we describe as our ‘conscious self’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The neuron has chemical properties.  These chemical properties which involve the consequence of the cellular transfer of one of four electrolytes, calcium, potassium, sodium or chloride, adjust through that process of transfer across the cell walls, to a state where their adjusting levels can be described as learning.  Each neuron receives ‘input’ from some previous neuron, or neurons, and when that input ‘sums’ to a certain amount of activity, the neuron ‘fires’, its axons stimulating other neurons.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is the firing of neurons earlier in the chain of connections that adjusts the levels of cellular wall transfer of those electrolytes, and this change adjusts their capacity for potentiation.  They become more or less potentiated, and are thus more, or less susceptible to being stimulated to ‘firing’.  When a neuron ‘fires’ an ‘electrical potential’ is created.  Neurons are widely misconstrued as having within their process, some discharge of electricity.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">However, the reference to ‘electrical potential’ refers to the chemical state of the neuron’s dendrites which adjust to allow a changing electrical potential to be transferred to the end of the axon, the synapse, which is then stimulated to release neurochemicals into the inter synaptic cleft, a space between the end of the axon and the next neuron’s cellular body or dendrites<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn1" id="bodyftn1">1</a></span>.  There are no sparks, or electrical activity; the electrical potential is simply a statement that there exists a difference between two places in terms of the capacity for molecular transfer.  There are something like 14 billion neurons in the brain of a healthy adult, and the different arrangements of connections that are possible allow the brain to ‘store’ representations of the experiences of the body.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A model of the way in which this system can represent information, and learn properties of the external world, is provided by connectionism.  Connectionism is a mathematical formalism, that is described sufficiently accurately to be realised as a computational model, and in the study of its properties and functioning, it has been revealed to have many similarities of outcome to the human psyche.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Some consider it to be a good model of how the human mind works.  I am not one of them, in a manner of speaking.  Although I centre on the connectionist model as fundamental to understanding where to locate the mechanism of conscious existence, I do not believe that the neural system works in a simplistic connectionist manner.  Instead it arrives at the sub-symbolic representational states, through translation of neural assemblies responsible for the physiological effectors.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Of prime importance, and one of the principle focal points of this book, is the role of the cardiovascular system with regards to its impact on the neural network, something that seems to be missing in the small amount of reading I have engaged in with regards to connectionism.  ‘Anti-psychotic’ ‘medications’ don’t lend themselves, in terms of their impact on attentional style, to allowing the imbiber to read, or sit still comfortably, or move around, or concentrate for any length of time, and so reading has been out of bounds for me for the majority of the last twenty years.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The observation of the role of the cardiovascular system, and of the role of the physiological effectors may seem quite obvious to the informed reader, I have been a little out of touch for the last twenty years, unfortunately.  I would hope that the science of the mind has arrived at the place that I reached almost twenty years ago, but I note that much of science seems to be disappearing into the silent and private <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">laboratories</span> of commercial application.  So, perhaps public research hasn’t yet appreciated the ‘insights’ that I provide.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The principle thing that I wish to communicate about the neuron is quite simple.  It is that despite the different locations and seeming morphological differences of the different ‘types’ of neurons, they all work in a fundamentally similar manner in one important respect.  That is that when a neuron fires, it creates a waste product, that has some property that could be described as ‘acidic’.  As the ‘acidity’ begins to build up, that neuron becomes less useful and other near neighbours share the firing.  Those neighbours might be connected or they might simply be located in proximity to that neuron, I do not know.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The overall neural system, then becomes biased by that emerging complex of neurons, in terms of the cardiovascular systems hydraulic delivery of blood to that neuron.  As the cardiovascular hydraulics concentrate on that neural complex, fresh oxygen and nutrient rich blood is delivered to that complex and the ‘acidity’ lowers.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I consider that neurons fire, then, when blood is supplying them with nutrients and oxygen.  For that to occur, I suggest, movement needs to occur, so that the blood flowing is some part of that process that encourages ionic transfer of electrolytes at the neuron.  So, when one sees alpha, gamma, delta, theta waves etc., one is seeing a particular type of movement of blood past those activated neurons, and I suggest that the discriminable wave forms of EEGs are related to the movement of blood due to the phases of pumping that occur in the ventricles of the heart, i.e. the cardiac cycle.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Furthermore, I imagine that the movement of that blood and the resultant ‘waves’ that reflect the activation of neurons, potentially do so in a ‘circular’ fashion, in such a way that the left and right hemispheres are the recipients of increased pressure of blood one after the other, as a consequence of the pumping actions of the legs, and the consequence of walking.  This ‘circular’ movement of pressures, in conjunction with the evolutionary consequence of a system that has the bound and in effect, circular, sphincter muscles, affords the creation of traumatic cycles, which I discuss in chapter 6.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">I will include a short chapter here on the subject of neurogenesis, which is the term given to the fact that new neurons are ‘born’ into existence.  Recently, it has been observed that neurogenesis continues to occur well into a person’s 6<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span> decade of life.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The little that I have read about the subject, tends to gloss over the actual process of neurogenesis, instead assuming that the reader will agree that the new neurons just ‘appear’ as though they had been wished into existence.  Neurogenesis is observed but not explained, at least in my extremely minimal experience of a limited public reading of the field.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Since this book includes in its title ‘notes for further research’, I shall note down here, the idea that neurons are not born and do not develop like sea monkeys in a tank of salt water, instead they are formed as part of a process of the interaction of fat, soaked in minerals, with the ‘acidic’ waste products of firing neurons.  Then one can see neurogenesis as part of the process of catharsis of stress, where the neural assemblies find themselves under stress, and then where they cannot catharsise their stress and dissipate it into other, existing neural assemblies, ultimately to observable behaviour, then they catharsise their stress through the production of new neurons, which allows them to grow as assemblies to be able to handle that stressful situation without producing sufficient waste product to either create new neurons or interfere with their functioning.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This would suggest that the cellular composition of the glial cells of the walls of the neuron, might actually be constructed due to a reaction between mineral soaked fat and waste product of existing neurons.  Different neural shapes may perhaps be a result of the different distributions of minerals in those areas where they occur, as a consequence of cardiovascular innervation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Neurogenesis, due to a molecular consequence of the way in which the ‘acidity’ of neural waste products affect fat, continues to occur across all areas of the brain during youth, but as we become adults, neurogenesis tails off except for a few areas, like the hippocampus, not because it is not possible, but because we have encountered enough experience to have created a sufficient amount of neural origins and resulting neural complexes, to be able provide a sufficient amount of neurally isomorphic structures for all new experience to be capable of sublimating neurally (a process I describe in the next chapters).</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I need to read more about the subject, to understand it properly, but my first thought is that this process occurs without requiring some stem cell or similar; it is a reaction between fat and the content of the blood that innervates that fat.  Also, neurogenesis, can be thought of as part of that process that is the catharsis of excess ‘energy’ where the existing neural assembly cannot efficiently represent, where represent includes ability to recall, some experience or other.  I discuss the idea of neurogenesis as part of a process of catharsis during the establishment of representation, later on in chapter 13, on Language and Thought.  There are other processes that can be included under the rubric of neural catharsis.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When a neuron fires and there is no connection to some other neuron, then if the acidity occurs regularly enough with a proximal neuron proving to be useful in lowering acidity levels, then a dendrite begins to form between the two neurons.  Where that dendrite is used so regularly that it might otherwise experience harm, a neuron begins to form.  Perhaps dendrites precede neurons in evolution?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 3:</span> <a id="a3Neuralcomplexesandneuralorigins"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">Neural complexes and neural origins</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Throughout this book, I make reference to neural complexes which I also call neural assemblies.  Neural complexes are groups of neurons that fire collectively, in a way in which they are discriminable from other neurons, and in their shared discriminability, they fire collectively to represent some feature or aspect of the environment.  So a neural complex may be one or many, perhaps distally located, inter-connected neural assemblies. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As neurons across the entire brain are firing, all of the time, to any perceived scene, in a continuous dynamic motion, a ‘seed’ of the neural complex can be discriminated, that I refer to as a neural origin, purely by being concentrated in a similar location, which allows the cardiovascular system to concentrate cardiovascular resources on it, to encourage it to fire.  Other neurons fire co-incidentally with the neural origin, due to connections between it and other areas, such as the auditory cortex and the sum of coincident activation is a neural complex.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is important to point out that there are no groups of neurons that represent a ‘car’ inside the brain, nor are there any groups of neurons that represent any other ‘thing’ or event.  The neural complexes that we have in the brain, represent muscle groups, or the dissolved features of the more complex perceptual system, both in fact, as all areas of the brain are firing at the same time.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It would be perfectly acceptable, I think, to guess that after the retinal neurons have been dissolved into their constituent features, area V1, the striate cortex generally, etc, they are reassembled into a coherent and ‘meaningful’ visual ‘scene’ at the terminal end of that ‘pathway’.  However, there is no need to assume some complete model in the brain, since the only information that stays alive is that which we need in order to interact with that thing.  Connections between these functionally maintained neurons and the perceptual areas of the CNS are maintained, and it is the firing of these perceptual areas that gives us the fundamental internal experience of perception of some object.  When later imagining the object, the process of dissolving into constituent features occurs in reverse.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I am guessing this, from a belief that there are thermodynamic properties of the neural system, where the perceived visual scene, for instance, creates a coherent representation at the ‘other end’ of the firing neurons, and that the analytical structures of feature inspection occur afterwards, as a process of inability to ‘contain’ the neural activity.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The overloaded pathway of visual recognition, then creates the feature inspection devices of the striate cortex, as increased activity creates new neurons and new connections are made.  These novel connections and neurons occur where the perceived shape is different from any previous experience, and, under an analytical analysis of the process of visual recognition, it may only be these novel neurons/connections that can be thought of as information specific to that representation.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I am fairly certain that neural complexes form around the arteries, veins and capillaries of the CNS cardiovascular system as a consequence of the regular movement of blood to those locations, with a certain amount present at birth, due to development from intra-natal movement.  So, at the point at which brachiation (branching) occurs, the resulting turbulence sees the nutrients of the blood-cells ejected into the surrounding area, and that it is here that the initial ‘seeds’ of neural complexes occur, the instances of which are what I am referring to as a ‘neural origin’.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I use the term ‘neural origin’ and one might draw the idea from the name that it is one place where more complex neural representations develop from.  However, I ought to point out that, in my opinion, there are many neural origins for the same representation.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What occurs when a person is bringing a representation to mind, is that the brain stimulates whatever neural origins it can that are in anyway related to the desired resultant representation (memory), and those neural origins are developed or diminished in their firing and ultimate influence as neural biases.  They are developed if they cause a ‘feeling’ of familiarity that is associated with the to-be-recovered information.  That ‘feeling’ is the activation of distal neural groups that are involved in the motivation of the organs.  Those distal neural groups of our own anatomical extended physiology are part of what is essentially an external environment, but one that we carry around with us.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I think these ‘clouds’ of neurons that surround the ‘pipe’ of the artery or vein, may be the ‘neural origin’, stretching along that pipe, from the turbulence at the dividing vein.   The representation of some experience is then constrained, through a process of inhibition, by allowing dissipation of energy, from the neural origin, into the rest of the neocortex, and the greater neural complex that is the consequence of this dissipation is what creates the constraints on the experience that can then encourage links to other areas, or novel combinations of behaviour etc.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The constraint that occurs, that is the neural assembly (a bunch of neurons that fire coincidentally on the presentation of some stimulus) which is the result of inhibition of behaviour, develops in concert with experience of the follow through from that neural origin in the past.  From the moment that that neural origin is located with cardiovascular resources, the inhibition of the development of that neural origin into a neural complex occurs, probably because of the concentration of activity due to ‘reflection’, a process I discuss later (figure 4).  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Continuously inhibited, through neural catharsis (the release of neural potential into clouds of unrelated neurons), the activation is slowly allowed to occur.  There is an exception which is the gross motor movements and other behaviours important to our evolutionary survival, the neural origins of which are present in the areas of the cardiovascular system that have the greatest cross-sectional area.  Those areas receive such instantaneous and high levels of cardiovascular resources that they are immediately more powerful than any constraint likely to inhibit them.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, what of brain morphology?  Where does this ‘theory’ that I am proposing stand regarding the differently formed structures internal to the brain, that are reported as having different functional roles to play in our conscious experience?  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I sort of ignore them, as it happens, since the modules are part of brain function, that I am assuming, without study, that are formed genetically, from repeated experience of the same phenomenon by our recent and distant ancestors.  I mean to suggest that the brain morphology generally is formed genetically, not the behaviours themselves that are represented in those ‘modules’.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The morphologically different areas of the modules, which are the substance of Fodor’s modularity of mind<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn2" id="bodyftn2">2</a></span>, are separate areas of the extended neural complex, representing different potential functions.  They ‘work’ i.e. function internally, in grossly similar ways though.  I would be particularly interested to examine Fodorism from the point of view of the innervating cardiovascular resources.  The modules present to the adrenals, discriminable areas of activity in terms of cardiovascular innervation. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I might predict, on the basis of my model, that those ‘functional’ ‘modules’ that are closer to receiving greater, more instantly provided, cardiovascular resources are more likely attuned to functions that are available as observable behaviour in a more immediate manner.   In other words, if you need some behaviour instantly, on a regular basis, the module that is closest to receiving cardiovascular resources, if any, will become associated with that function.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Whilst there might be few physical experiences that we are likely to be able to divide into certainly contingently related modules, language always presents the same basic environment.  In English, there is subject-verb-object relationship, for example.  Whilst one module might be responsible for the object, another might be responsible for the subject, and yet others for the relations between them, or the descriptive adjectives etc.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I doubt that FMRI studies have enough resolution, currently, to provide a meaningful study of the suggestion, though, although I hope that I’m wrong.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 4:</span> <a id="a4Thecardiovascularsystem"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">The cardiovascular system</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The cardiovascular system responds to the sites of activity neurally, by concentrating resources on that area.  It does so by release of mineralocorticoids at the adrenal glands.  The stomach digests food, churning out chyme that is rich in serotonin.  The chyme pools near the adrenal glands and the muscular contractions of the colon force the serotonin-containing chyme against the pyloric sphincter, through into the fat surrounding the distal tubules of the nephrons of the kidneys, where the serotonin is then filtered into its separate mineralocorticoids, with a large percentage of that being testosterone and oestrogen.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">These two molecules have a particular type of effect on the blood. Testosterone lubricates the blood cell containing rhesus in a way that facilitates an increase in speed of the movement of those blood cells where that speed is part of a vector that describes a movement parallel to the vein or artery – laminar flow.  Oestrogen ‘inflates’ the artery or vein, increasing the transverse pressure of the blood local to it.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Testosterone and oestrogen are in balance, simply as part of a more complex hydraulic consequence that affects the bodies ability to locate blood, concentrating it where it is needed.  Hence the levels of testosterone and oestrogen differ between the different shaped genders.  The different distributions, by gender, reflect the different shape of the individuals and the different demands on the neural system in terms of the distribution of fat around the body.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The blood is made up of the rhesus, and contains the blood cells, as well as many other particles, such as fibrinogen, platelets, and other particles useful in bodily process.  The blood cells are sponges, that soak up nutrients and oxygen, and, where turbulence is sufficiently high, they eject their contents.  That turbulence occurs at the joints, principally, and at other points of brachiation (branching).  There, at least some of the blood cells eject their contents.  After they have passed the complex, multiply branching areas of the joint, with its many capillaries and veins, they begin to soak up the waste products of the muscles that are attached at the joints.  The muscles have a fibrous arrangement that squeezes the waste products towards those areas of the joints.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The blood cells, rhesus etc., when a person is healthy, is <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">of sufficiently low viscosity</span> to be able to pass through the porous substance of the bone, the turbulence that that journey creates, creating eddies and whirlpools that literally tear new cells out of the bone marrow, that then replenish the amount of blood cells in the blood.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There are ‘white’ cells, which, I suspect, randomly occur, in increasing number with increasing levels of health, that are simply superfluous to the needs of the cardiovascular system in terms of the transport of nutrient and oxygen.  When the blood is too viscous<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn3" id="bodyftn3">3</a></span> to pass through the bone, or perhaps when the normally porous bone is blocked, a diminishment of the creation of new blood cells occurs, and hypovolaemia is the result.   With less blood cells occurring, no white cells occur, and conditions like HIV are a consequence, possibly, something I discuss in chapter 31.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The blood that is passing the adrenal glands, is transported up the ascending arteries, past the intestinal tract, where it receives nutrients, and past the lungs where it receives oxygen.  It then hits the weeping willow like complex brachiation of the venous system that enters from the left and the right into the intra cranial area.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As the blood passes the adrenal glands, the mineralocorticoids spurt into the blood stream.  These mineralocorticoids are sufficiently small and uniform to act as a lubricant to what are irregularly shaped blood blood cells.  The blood cells are irregularly shaped because they are in different states of absorption or ejection of waste or of nutrients/oxygen etc.  So, they bounce around irregularly, regularly bouncing off other blood cells, impeding their progress.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The introduction of the mineralocorticoids, fills the space between the blood cells with what is effectively a shot of WD40.  The gaps between the blood cells are filled and the transport of the blood cells is smoother, and less viscous as a result.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><img alt="Image8" class="frameGraphics" id="Image8graphic" src="material_psychology_of_consciousness-img/material_psychology_of_consciousness-img003.png" style="float:left;margin-left:0.1953in" /></p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><a id="Figure2Mineralocorticoidrelease"></a><span style="font-size:14.0px">Figure 2.  Irregular shaped blood blood cells are ‘lubricated’ by the introduction of the regular sized, small 	particles of the mineralocorticoids.  This helps to preserve, briefly, the laminar properties that the 	distribution of irregular shaped blood cells has for the resultant deformation of the topographical 	representation of blood pressure.  That deformation sees the blood meaningfully located in terms 	of its distribution through the multi branching intra CNS venous system.  It also creates a 	‘hydraulic block’ that has a resultant pressure increase at the other end of the artery, at the 	CNS.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Imagine a cross section through the artery and focus on that red disk that is the blood.  Now topographically distort that red disk, so that it has different height peaks and troughs.  Label the peaks as less viscous and the troughs as <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">more</span> viscous.  The consequence of that distorted pressure map, principally, occurs when it arrives at the complex brachiation of the cardiovascular system of the brain.  That distorted pressure map then, that is the result of mineralocorticoid release from the adrenals, effects the relative extent of travel down the different veins, arteries, and capillaries in the brain, ultimately able to affect the concentration of blood in different areas of the brain.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Where the relative levels of testosterone and oestrogen released by the adrenal glands might be considered fine tuning of the concentrated upon area of the central nervous system, the ‘acidity’ of the neurons surrounding the veins and capillaries of the central nervous system cardiovascular pathways, and the consequence of that acidity for the dilation/constriction of those pathways, acts in a larger way in terms of the consequence for the concentrated blood in the body.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One can think of the consequence of mineralocorticoid release as ‘lubricating’ the blood, but there is another, more primary artefact of the release.  This is to fill the intra-blood cell space, causing a hydraulic block, like one might find below the foot on the brake of a car.  The consequence of that hydraulic blockage, sees an immediate change in the focus of concentrated blood in the CNS.  So, the topographic deformation of the intra-arterial viscosity occurs to ‘steer’ the blood so that it will arrive at its end position, and then a <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">continued</span> ejection of mineralocorticoids creates the hydraulic block, so that at the terminal end of the cardiovascular system, in the brain, the correct area is ‘foveated’ with ‘pressurised’ blood.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is how we ‘think’ effectively, in the sense that this process concentrates available resources in specific areas.  When those resources reach that concentrated upon area, the neurons fire.  Of course, they can fire for different reasons as well, and when they fire, they become a bias on the complex process of cardiovascular hydraulics, something that I dub resource allocation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, with that hydraulic process that is the adrenal glands ‘foveating’ pressurised blood onto the neural system, it is worth considering the process of homeostasis. This is an insight that as a more complex facet of this process, I have less ability to model with ease in my mind, and is something that may or may not be bourne out by scientific observation.  This insight is to suggest that the reason homeostasis occurs is not because of temperature regulation, but that temperature regulation is an artefact of a different process, which is the adjustment of the body’s situation, across a variety of different measures, in order to make certain that, in general, blood is delivered through the action of the heart muscle etc. to the neurons of the CNS, in a regular fashion.  It is the adjustment of the adrenal glands so that the pressurised adrenal hydraulic block has meaningful interaction with the foveated site, intra-cranially.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The adjustment toward a temperature is an artefact of maintaining that background movement of blood with a regular, ‘normal’, amount of pressure, but the temperature adjustment is the consequence of many glands, the organs, the intake of oxygen at the lungs, and across the sinuses etc. all working in harmony according to the directive of the homeostatic drive, to continuously regulate the blood flow and its pressure intra CNS, such that when the adrenals engage in that process of foveation of pressurised blood, it can activate the neurons that it foveates, with certainty.   Effectively, the process of homeostasis, is the regulation of cardiovascular resources such that they remain within a consistent range, so that the adrenals don’t fail to foveate blood in the CNS efficiently.  Neural blood flow must remain constant for any changes in pressure or location to be meaningful.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One other consequence of neurons firing, becoming a bias on resource allocation, is worth mentioning, and that is that pain is the single greatest bias on resource allocation.  When the skin is broken, or some other irregular event occurs that causes us pain, the pain is the neurons firing so rapidly as the resources cannot meet their needs, sometimes because those resources are spurting all over the place.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Pain, in almost every case that I have observed, is simply the neurons not getting these resources, so back pain, for instance, which I can state is the neurons not receiving resources, may be a consequence of the veins and capillaries being so compressed in those locations, that the blood simply can’t get to that location.  Sometimes pain occurs because of the situation of muscles that have become swollen due to damage.  The swollen muscles block the transport of venous resources to the muscles and this leaves the neurons at those sites short of nutrient and oxygen rich blood.  The consequence is that acidic by-products of neurons firing build up in those areas, and this is what causes the pain.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Taking medicines which encourage the swelling to reside, allows fresh blood to those areas and the healthier process of neural relaxation can contribute to the continuation of the diminishment of the swelling.   I will look at what this model that I am proposing can state about physical illness and infarction later on in the section ‘normal psychology’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Consciousness, on the other hand, which requires that the brain be immediately attentive to its perception of the immediate environment, requires the immediate biasing of the cardiovascular system in order to motivate it to change the position of the focal points of greatest blood pressure intra-cranially.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A number of maladaptive issues can occur with regards to the locating of the blood in the ‘correct’ location intra-cranially, many of which, I suspect, result in perceived mental health issues.   For example, in a man who is experiencing anger issues, it may be found that for one reason or another, the blood that is focused on the neural assembly that is one of the neural origins, may find itself forced past that origin. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Because physical behaviour, of which language is a part, starts with gross uncoordinated bodily movements, before becoming more refined, the neurons further away from an ideal pressure, of blood resources around the vein, represent a less finely tailored movement.  So, a person who is experiencing anger may simply find that the blood is over or under shooting its target location.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The causes of such an event might be to do with the imbibement of some liquid that adjusts cardiovascular viscosity, such as alcohol, or that opens up or closes the ‘pores’ of the veins in that area, and thus allow greater or lesser amounts of blood to find the neural origin.  Lead or similar heavy metals, can gather in troughs of the cardiovascular system, intra-cranially, where the flow of the vein moves downwards and then upwards again.  Lead accumulates at that trough, and then blocks it, turning it into a micro valve.  The blood then builds up in pressure at that point, and then ‘explodes’ past it, forcing the location of the blood that is centred on the correct neural origin to suddenly move further away from the ideal centre.  The consequence is that the individual’s verbalisation will be aggressive in tone.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Rapidly or repeatedly increased levels of fat distribution, can lead to a similar ‘micro-valve’ effect, perhaps after a panic attack, that can lead to a lasting consequence of more exaggerated behaviour in certain circumstances.   Glue sniffing, can lead to the lasting blockage of veins that are peripheral to the allocation of cardiovascular resources, and then behaviour can become exaggerated, leading to what looks like a violent stand on some issue, as the behaviour becomes jerky, and exaggerated behavioural stereotypy is incorporated in to the individual’s behavioural response set. The smaller veins allow the firing of complimentary neural assemblies in the brain that allow the dissipation of neural potential in a targeted manner with fine resolution.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In each case the micro valves are unknown to the adrenal circuit, i.e. they are not built into our catalogue of normal behaviours.  This most likely means that our successful survival through evolution hasn’t been contingent on these circumstances i.e. they haven’t occurred enough in our evolutionary past for there to exist any contingent neural behaviour.  So, the consumption of lead, and certainly glue sniffing, are events that we have experienced only in the latest evolutionary environment.  There is also the case where the adrenal circuit is unable to make accurate predictions or accurate ‘foveation’ of the CNS area, because of some relatively enduring period of stress that stretches the cardiovascular cross section.  I discuss this in more depth in the introduction to abnormal psychology.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, where neural activity is reaching some level of activation, the adrenal glands are stimulated to release some level of mineralocorticoids in response.  The neurons may be in the brain, or the body.  The level of activation that stimulates the adrenal response is probably defined by the amount of waste product that is generated by neural activation, and it is the effect of the waste product on the efficiency of neural activation as a bias, that is a likely bias of the adrenal response.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There is another, though, in a stunning example of ‘mind over matter’.  When we worry about some pain, or position in our body, this can act as a bias in concentrating resources, or at least exaggerating the amount of resources that are delivered to that area.  This is perhaps one of the causes of that phrase, ‘worrying about it will only make it worse’.  I examine this consequence of continuous concern on the motivation of resources to some area of the CNS, in the chapter on Cancer.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0">Addendum.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Since I wrote this chapter, I have visited a locum endocrinologist at the local hospital, for an investigation, and, in conversation, he stated that testosterone supplements were no longer considered for men, due to evidence that testosterone thickens the blood and makes it ‘stickier’.  I looked up the phenomenon, and found the articles to which he was referring, that related that testosterone supplements in men with normal levels had almost two and half times the chance of developing pulmonary embolisms due to blood clots forming.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This is perfectly understandable.  One has to appreciate what is happening when a person cuts themself.  The events that happen are that the blood, disappearing from the area where the cut exists, leaves the neurons surrounding that cut unable to flush away the waste products of their firing, which causes the sensation of pain.  The neural system immediately responds by biasing the neural system so that blood is delivered to the site.  This biasing is achieved by immediately releasing mineralocorticoids at the arteries near the adrenal glands, which causes a hydraulic block such that blood is foveated, immediately, at the other end of the artery, in the Central Nervous System.  The foveation on this area, changes the cardiovascular ‘gating’ of blood being pumped through the brain, so that the cardiovascular system is biased to force blood in increased measure toward the area where the cut has occurred.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What the journals are observing, when describing that the chance of blood clots occurring increases when men with normal levels of testosterone are administered testosterone supplements, is that the body responds to sudden increases in testosterone over a certain level, by increasing the chance of presence of particles such as fibrinogen, and other particles necessary for clotting.  However clotting, doesn’t occur unless the endothelial cells of the venous walls are damaged.  Where those venous walls are damaged, the fibrinogen in the rhesus meets the collagen and tissue factor, starts a coagulation cascade, creating thrombin and other factors associated with clotting.  The increased chance of clotting, is most likely that the increased amount of testosterone starts to increase the speed of blood flow to the extent that tissue factor and other clotting agents are drawn through the cell walls by the increased speed of that blood flow causing a vacuum effect to suck the materials through from the collagen into the veins.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I would suggest that when a person is cut, the increased speed of blood flow through the lesion, would draw clotting agents from through the venous walls of the veins approaching the lesion, in order for the process of clotting to begin just prior to reaching the lesion.  When there is an increase in testosterone, the increased speed of flow of blood mimics this process of speed-increase-due-to-lesion, and the result is clots.  However, another explanation of the increase in clotting, may result from appreciating why thrombosis often occurs, problematically, in the upper leg.  It has been observed, that the thigh has a far higher level of carbon-dioxide present than other areas.  Perhaps testosterone’s influence, above normal levels, on clotting, has something to do with its role in mediating carbon-dioxide levels in the blood.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Clotting in blood, is an enormously complex, multi faceted event, with many different factors involved.  One of these is the release of serotonin, during primary hemostasis, and this serotonin may be part of some interaction with the increased amount of testosterone in the case of supplement use.  Where studies have noted increased clotting, did they take into account the use of SSRi medications by their cohort of participants?  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I am also of the opinion that it might be the case that implants are being used to diminish testosterone levels in certain cases, where psychiatrists have established some belief that a patient might be at risk of offending, in the case that that patient is prone to violence or sexual aggression.  This type of practice by the medical authorities, that would be prevented by human rights legislation, might lead to a point where we find ourselves in a situation where study results are not reported in public.  Utilitarianism, where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, is often used to justify the allowance of harm to come to individuals.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The specialist stated that testosterone increases the size of the blood cells.  He stated, also, that that was the likely cause of the clotting, that testosterone causes clotting by making blood cells larger.  I would suggest that blood cells become larger, when there is an increased concentration of testosterone, because the cells are moving quicker, and this leaves them hydraulically (at some level), drawing in more contents from the surrounding rhesus.  The testosterone increases the speed of movement. That speed of movement increases the size of the blood cells.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">However, it should be noted that I present this book as notes and observations for future research, as I have previously stated, and that I am not, in any way, an expert on physiology or neurophysiology or any other field of study particularly.  I simply became interested with the possibility that the adrenals could release mineralocorticoids which might then create a hydraulic block that would manipulate the areas of pressurised blood in the CNS.  Even if this turns out not to be the case in humans, it might prove to be useful in pursuit of understanding how to create some model or other of ‘strong AI’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 5:</span> <a id="a5Neuralsublimation"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">Neural sublimation and neural biases</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Neural sublimation is the process of forming or updating a neural complex, such that a neural origin then has the capacity to re-instigate that neural complex into existence in a way that may then be of use in the processing of that environmental experience that stimulated the formation of the neural complex and its sublimation.  Effectively, neural sublimation describes the process of forming neural assemblies that are representative of some behaviour or perceptual response to the environment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The process of sublimation is the process of dissolving into constituent parts that are recallable, the individual’s experience in that time frame that is consistent with the discrimination of that experience as separate from other experiences.  The neural state, which is continuous with the greater bodily state and ultimately visible behaviour, is then dissolved into its constituent features, and those features that are not necessary to maintain with regards to ‘reawakening’ the origin of that neural complex in that environmental circumstance, are lost, able to be reconstructed as the neural complex fires.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Those features that are ‘lost’ are already represented, sufficiently well to recall them, in neural origins elsewhere.  When the complex is developing, it ‘ignites’ briefly, the representation of what those ‘lost’ features are, by implying them as invisible parts of the developing complex, and they are then rebuilt into the neural complex.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">My point, is that an important part of the process of neural sublimation is the fact that the brain does not represent the same feature any more often than it has to, and does so, most likely, only once.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Though someone might take this to suggest that there is a single, fixed location for some concept and its retrieval, I suggest that it is the whole neural complex that is firing that represents some object or experience.  The precursor to some represented object are small parts of that experience, where the firing neural assemblies, which I refer to as ‘neural origins’ have some relationship to the final neural representation. These neural origins are increasingly concentrated on in terms of the cardiovascular resources that are delivered to them.  As they continue to fire, other areas come and go, depending on their utility in awakening the final representation.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When considering the process of neural sublimation, the salient features in terms of discriminating that response in that environment and that environment alone, are kept, their ‘tonal distance’ i.e. the structural ‘distance’ in logical difference between them being maintained.  This process of ‘losing information’ continues, until the resulting neural analogue can be fitted to an existing neural origin.  That existing neural origin will be selected because it is both similar enough to allow the re-tasking of existing neural structures and also because it will not conflate other representations with the recall of that neural complex that is being ‘remembered’; perhaps ‘recovered’ is a more descriptively succinct term.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">That existing neural origin will also be discerned as a potential location for the neural origin of that to-be-recalled experience that is being sublimated, according to the requirement of being able to immediately reacquire that neural complex in those circumstances.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If it is a neural complex that needs to be recalled instantly, for the sake of survival, then the origin occurs nearer to the larger cross sectional area arteries, or veins, etc.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, coded into the neural origin, is the neural complex or neural complexes that it awakes, the environment that it occurs in perceptually, including all of the automatic responses to that environment, such as potentiated but inhibited linguistic responses, as well as the neural activity that acts to inhibit the development of that neural origin into a neural complex.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The neural complex, as it develops, then becomes the constraint, on the reinforcement of the awakening of the neural origins that then fire to bring that complex into existence.   The neural system in the brain, the Central Nervous System (CNS) is continuously experiencing a ‘fight’ between competing neural areas as they compete to become the overarching neural bias on overt behaviour.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What occurs at the level of the cardiovascular system is a form of physiological cognitive dissonance, since the neural activity is distributed in one of two gross, overarching ways, to engage or not in the behavioural pattern created by the neural complexes that are unfolding, waking up other neural complexes as they do, so that the neural complexes are like branches that we are reaching out and grasping as we swing through the trees, one leading to another, ignoring places to grasp that will not support us.  Perhaps the same process can be viewed under a metaphor of currents in the sea, but the fanning out neural complexes are rather like branches, so I use that metaphor in preference.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Ultimately, the complexity of the cardiovascular system internal to the brain, contributes to the mineralocorticoid release necessary to retain cardiovascular pressure at both the neural origin, and at the resulting neural complex, as well as its complementary neural inhibition, and this leaves the mineralocorticoid release at the adrenal glands, that is necessary to maintain the concentrated upon brain-cardiovascular pressure, being highly salient in terms of discriminable brain states.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In other words, for each recoverable brain state, there exists some discriminable adrenal complex.  The adrenal complexes are just that though, they are complexes of mineralocorticoid release that are capable of creating a resultant pressure in the brain that will see the delivery of cardiovascular resources to some area or areas of the brain that are necessary to activate in order to recall that neural complex.  As neural complexes continue to sublimate, neural origins are adjusted, and it is the capacity of the neural feedback of the adrenal circuit to adjust the release of mineralocorticoids that sees the person maintaining the ability to continue locating cardiovascular resources on that position in the brain.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This is why I suggest that the adrenal glands are far more important in comprehending mental health conditions, with adrenal issues being one of the principal causes of mental health issues.  Adrenal issues can be due to blocked or diminished transport of mineralocorticoid, or can be some other cause, such as exhaustion which can affect the thixotropy of the flesh, that I describe in chapter 7 when on the subject of the distal tubules of the nephrons of the kidneys.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Neural assemblies, neural complexes (multiple assemblies), and neural origins, are all terms of reference that I use for the different locations of neural activity.  Any neural activity that occurs is a bias on behaviour.  There is no situation where there is a one to one mapping between neural activity and observable behaviour for instance. Observable behaviour is the consequence of the aggregative effect of all neural biases that might affect that behaviour.  In the case of movement this means that a neural assembly might form to motivate the direction of the arm.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Being a gross motor movement, the neural assembly will form near a point of brachiation in an area of the intra-cranial cardiovascular system that is larger in cross surface area, so an artery.  All biases that are present as that assembly fires will affect the ultimate vector of behaviour, but because it is so important in the case of gross motor movements to correctly locate them, the presence of the underlying neural assembly nearer to the artery etc., leaves the observable behaviour less influenced by neural biases.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the case of language, on the other hand, there are less consequences of arriving at an incorrect vector for the observable (audible) behaviour of the tongue and other speech effectors.  So there are more occasions in language production, and comprehension, when there are obvious interference from biases, such as occurs when one experiences some Freudian slip.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">At any given moment, though, the neural complexes that are the result of neural sublimation, represent more than just one experience/event/object etc, and as biases, form as recall begins to occur.  They are dynamic, in the sense that they form and then dissipate if they are not useful as biases on overt behaviour.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 6:</span> <a id="a6Traumaticcycle"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">Traumatic cycles</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A traumatic cycle is a cycle of neuronal firing, that is a self-reinforcing examination of the current physical environment by subconscious perceptual mechanisms, in order to locate some putative source of danger.  A traumatic cycle is instigated by a trauma, which stands out from the background, cognitively, to such a great extent, that the neural origin that occurs leads to a self-reinforcing neural complex, where the neural complex, when fully realised, and as part of it fading from view, in terms of activations, reprises itself, by reawakening the neural origin. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This traumatic cycle must occur, as the repeated inspection of the external environment is necessary for survival.  Just because a danger can’t be seen, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.  This evolutionary prerogative is what gives rise to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I examine PTSD and a putative cure, eye movement desensitization and reprogramming (EMDR), in chapter 24: Trauma, PTSD and EMDR.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I suggest that the traumatic cycle is one way of establishing long term potentiation (LTP).  I also suggest, at a greater than neural level, that repeated exposure to an event can leave it becoming, through that repeated exposure, a salient feature that is of use to the mind.  Features of one’s environment fall into this category as do any repeated event.  What seems to be the common denominator is that repeated experience, where repeated experience of one’s home environment is a certainty leads to greater level of ease in recall.  The other principle process that ensures ease of recall is events that are traumatic.  These create a traumatic cycle, where the created neural complex refreshes itself as it sublimates, diminishing chances of it fading.  These two processes, repeated exposure and traumatic exposure then become principal biases on behaviour.  To coin a term, the totality of all the different biases at any given moment, can be thought of as the ‘cognitive landscape’ of the individual.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">You might recall that I mentioned that I suspect that blood innervates as a resource, the Central Nervous System, in a circular fashion due to the fact that walking provides a pumping mechanism that sees first one side pressurised, and then the other.  I suspect that this feature of primate life, walking, is the source of the circular ‘motion’ of the emergent neural complex that can be considered a traumatic cycle.  However, I think there is an evolutionary earlier correlate, that of the sphincter.  A sphincter is a bundle of muscles that contracts or dilates where the energy that initiates its movement travels in a circular motion around the sphincter, that circularly bound muscle fibres.  I would suggest that it is the existence of the self powering nature of the sphincter that lead evolution to reward us with neural complexes that are self reinforcing, and that these neural complexes became useful in measuring the existence of traumatic experience.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Some other property of neurons might also contribute to the development of traumatic cycles.  If you wave your hand under the water of a reasonably hot tap, you can sometimes perceive the feeling as ‘cold’.  Perhaps neural states do not occur in a linear way, but in a circular movement where extremes are similar?  In any case, the traumatic neural complex is a special case of a more general neural complex feature.  When passing some feature of the environment that can be interacted with, a neural complex is stimulate into existence, that underlies the muscular movement with which one interacts with that feature.   The neural complex is potentiated, but if the muscle movement isn’t appropriate or is chosen against, then the muscle behaviour is inhibited.  The neural complex remains potentiated though, until we sleep.  I discuss this in more detail in chapter 15.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In some cases of neural sublimation, the neural assembly is in the process of discarding information that is useless to it at that particular point, having already been coded into the structure of the emergent neural assembly, when it gets ‘stuck’, unable to continue sublimating.  This is described in connectionist theory as ‘the problem of local minima in gradient descent’ (figure 5).  This can be because it cannot find a more resolved situation, but the formed complex is too expensive in terms of neural firing for it to be efficiently useful.  It can also get stuck at some position in its descent towards some ideal position in terms of cognitive economy because of a traumatic cycle, which reawakens the neural origins that primed it into existence, every time it begins to diminish.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">I think that if you examine the physical configuration in space relative to each other, the distal tubules of the nephrons of the kidneys are an 'informational' structure, in the sense that they exist in that shape, that is depicted in the figure 2 below, when the person is standing up. When the person bends, twists, leans, or sits down, the distal tubules are contorted and that the consequent adjustment to the release of mineralocorticoids into the blood stream, is part of the way in which the cardiovascular hydraulics at the kidneys can inform our central nervous system of our current physical position, allowing sudden changes of posture to be communicated almost instantly, through a consequent 'hydraulic block' to the central nervous system, intra-cranially.  In effect, they are a sort of gyroscope, for maintaining orientation.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">Another feature of the distal convoluted tubules of the nephrons of the kidneys that is important to incorporate into an understanding of the conscious existence of the individual psyche is the consistency of the fat that they are suspended in.  This mass of fat, I suspect, is a thixotropic material, in the sense that it has the same property as tomato sauce.  When one spanks the bottle, the sauce becomes less viscous i.e. runnier.  I think that that is the case with the fat surrounding the tubules.  When the person is in a fight/flight state, more stress means a different relationship in terms of the sensitivity of posture feedback from the convoluted tubules.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This relationship might be due to a greater amount of salts in the gut, that then reasonably rapidly, soak into that thixotropic mass of fat, adjusting the thixotropy, leaving it harder, <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">more</span> viscous, such that the immediate, and rapidly changed increased acceleration of the movement of cardiovascular resources and consequent neural activity in the sensitive state, leaves any chance of sudden movement, regulated.  If this is the case, then the thixotropy of that fat is important to analyse in situations where there is an inability to pay attention in ways that incorporate the individual into the membership of 'normal'.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Autistic people may benefit from an examination of this relationship around the distal convoluted tubules as the principle parts of the autistic triad all share a need to have good attentional resources, readily available.  Also, soldiers, arriving on 'civvy street' from active service in war torn areas, might find that their continuous exposure to excitement and stress and the continuous need to concentrate for long periods of time, may leave that thixotropic mass, more continuously hard, and them less sensitive.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Perhaps a ‘hard man’ can be restored to 'normality'?  It is a question relating to an appreciation of scientific cultural imperialism, that sponsors the question.  Is it a good thing to judge a hard man as needing some adjustment of the adrenals?  Does society continue to need them, those hard men, or does it dream up opportunities for them to exist?  Personally, I think it takes all types, but I have seen ‘garden party set’ psychiatrists, that live in a candy floss, day dream world, consider people from the very much more ‘real’ housing estates as 'mad' simply because they are relating their normal daily process.  <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">O</span>ften that normal daily process is quite stereotyped, with the working class engaging in quite strictly managed vignettes of behaviour, a consequence of both the ready supply of traumatised people and the need for cognitive efficiency in social communicative exchange.  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times....  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The psychiatrists then create a medication regime, that slowly trains the patient out of their 'errant' thoughts, the pain of medication slowly being adjusted as one might use a stick to a donkey, a hundred years ago.  They then release the patient, who returns to their housing estate robbed of their ability to remain safe in the sometimes highly stressed world of living on top of one another.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">The body’s cardiovascular hydraulic ‘map’, might be considered under the rubric of bodily states.  I think personally, that there is no ‘map’ but that hydraulic pressure adjustment is a dynamic system adjusting to different circumstances.  However, there are consciously discriminable bodily states, which we sometimes label as emotions and I suspect that there exist, subconsciously, a great many more, discriminable bodily states.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> It is often stated and has been formally studied in the field of Psychology that there are seven basic emotional states. These include happiness, sadness, disgust, surprise, anger etc.  In order to understand something of the way in which we label our bodily states, consider an x/y graph with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical. Now draw a hundred thousand data points on the x axis (there are actually quite a lot more than this).  Each data point is a neuron and has a quantity of height that refers to the specific activation of that neuron. If you map the activation of these neurons across the different emotional states you should be able to group them via height (activation) at each time so you will have a graph that looks something like this (figure 4):</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-size:14.0px"><img alt="image3.png" class="frameGraphics" id="image3pnggraphic" src="material_psychology_of_consciousness-img/material_psychology_of_consciousness-img005.png" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;border:none;padding:0;background-color:transparent;float:left;margin-left:0in" />Figure 4.  <a id="Figure4neuralactivationgraph"></a>bodily states and neural activity. There are many emotional states, but there are seven that 'stand out' from the background with sufficient conformity between individuals to have been labelled with utility as happiness, sadness etc.  Note that neurons in this example are not physically located next to each other in the body/brain as might be implied by the graph, which indicates that they fire coincidentally.  Also, it is not to any scale, just a general indication.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The activation of the neurons during these states are labelled by reference to cultural norms that inform us to what these states are called, but the reality is that there are far more emotional states than just seven, it is just that these seven emotional states are certainly discriminable from the continuously varying activation levels of the other emotional states, in a way that we can recognise as being similar.  As the frontispiece of this book serves to demonstrate, the idea that there are only seven emotions is simply a convention that we have adopted.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As I discuss later, the idea of a discrete bodily state is important to understand as a function of memory, although our existence in concert with the environment is continuous, and as our continuously in motion body state exists, the mind flows continuously through our environment.  It is the similarity between individuals in terms of discriminating emotional states from the background of differing <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">body states</span> that exist at any given moment that offers us as individuals a knowable semantic referent, for the sake of labelling these states with predictive utility as communicative gestures. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">They are, effectively, hormonal ‘shapes’ that co-vary with the environment and repeat under similar circumstances with certitude.  These hormonal ‘shapes’ become a predictable co-varying environment that can act as a constraint on coding and later recall of information.   They are ‘hormonal shapes’ since the release of hormones is intrinsically related to our body shape, primarily by gender but then by inter-personal differences.  When I use the term ‘hormonal shape’ though, I also have in mind the neural ‘shape’ that is the activation of all of the neurons at this point in time as reflected by the resultant hormonal state.  These two systems, neural and hormonal, are loosely coupled, that is that there is no certainly predictable relationship between neural state and hormonal state at any given moment.   It is a bit like a delay pedal, where one plays a note on a guitar and the note occurs some microseconds later.  The hormones are the delayed consequence of the neural state, I suggest.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Neural homogeneity is worth describing, I think.  This is the possibility, which I tend to take as fact, that there are no separate neural systems in the body, and that all neurons influence one another.  Clinicians and theorists, tend to make lexicographic distinctions for the sake of brevity of distinction or more often, to group certain systems in the body together functionally.  However, the body is a single functioning organism, that does not recognise a difference between the central and peripheral nervous system.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Instead when one is talking about the body’s neural system, one is talking about the state of activation of all of the neurons at any given moment.  The separation into different ‘systems’ has been reified I think, with some imagining that there are separate systems, that are mutually exclusive from one another.  In fact there might actually be observably separate neural systems, but they will respond to each other’s activation through sharing the consequences for the cardiovascular or other interposed system.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I’m relatively certain that it makes sense from an information theoretic point of view, that there would be a minimum of two separate neural systems that would be joined by an interposed, morphologically separate system, which in this case would be the cardiovascular system.  Then one has a measure of experiential certainty that one can ascribe to any experience by the ‘distance’ between the PNS and the CNS, and such a system would allow a visceral experience of informational <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">devices</span> like cognitive dissonance.  In mentioning neural homogeneity, I tend to not see a difference between the PNS and the CNS, since neural innervation and activation should occur across the both areas with not real separation.  However, the hormonal system has that separation, sufficient to be a meaningful informational structure, particularly given its capacity to remain present, providing overlap between different neural states, and thus allowing them to locate themselves in a serial presentation of behaviour, which ultimately makes up the greater environment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">With certainty, from the point of view of the theoretical model that I present in this book, bodily states are part of an internal physiological environment, that co-varies meaningfully with external experience, and as such becomes an important constraint, with high informational relevance, to cognitive states.  It is effectively a set of exogenous biases that we carry into different environments, that also present exogenous cues, and it is in the isomorphic similarity between external environment of exogenous cues and internal physiological environment of exogenous cues, that we recognise that we have experienced the environment before, at least from the point of view of the ‘feeling’ or ‘body state’ that is elicited.   This feeling or body state then acts as a constraint on the development of cognitive structures, like neural complexes and origins etc. that are part of the process of recall, or communication, perhaps.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">To return to the suggestion of neural homogeneity,</span> the olfactory bulb which is located in the CNS is related to the gonads and the process of erection, in both men and women (in the sense that erection is the walls of the vagina firming up through receipt of blood), and that if one severs the veins of the olfactory bulb, reducing its sensitivity, one can will render the individual ‘sexless’ in the sense that they will not become aroused.  This observation is used by despots and thieves alike, in pursuit of a particular type of tyranny that I describe in appendix C.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In terms of neural homogeneity, I mean to point out that there seem to be thermodynamic consequences for the totality of neurons firing at any given moment, in the sense that one end of some area of the neural system ‘mirrors’ the other end. This organisation according to some set of relations that could be thought of as isomorphic with a thermodynamic system, leaves similar areas of the complete neural system, that are related in terms of function, mirroring one another to the point, across evolution, that their form becomes redolent of one another.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I think this sympathetic relationship between polar distal features indicates, more than anything else, that the neural system is a set of interconnected neurons that are situation agnostic, and that the totality of their firing on a regular basis, as a continuous dynamic system leaves that sympathetic relationship an emergent feature, resulting from the thermodynamic totality of the neural system.  This suggests, perhaps, that function proceeds form, and that form is slowly selected with regard to its utility across evolution in terms of its ‘best fit’ with functional demands.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The vagus nerve is particularly important to appreciate with regards to discriminable body states, with the vagus nerve’s primary function, I think, being the regulation of the swallow reflex and of later stomach wall contractions.  The vagus nerve prepares the stomach and colon for the arrival of food by communicating the effort of the swallow reflex to the rest of the apparatus of digestion.  The resulting consequence for the adrenals is of particular importance, I suspect, but in any case, according to at least one researcher, Dr Porges, the activity of the vagus nerve has been extended to affording communicative and social function between humans.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is noted that damage to the vagus nerve can result in uncontrollable eating, which is a result of its place in preparing the organs for food, and a certain treatment of the vagus nerve, can reduce tinnitus.  The inner ear, has hairs on it, that vibrate, and tinnitus, organic tinnitus, is due to the inability to function of some of these hairs that are a particular length.  Perhaps due to a form of alopetia that sees only hairs of a certain length being lost from the inner ear.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The hairs of the inner ear are connected probably via the vagus nerve, to the adrenals, the reason I suppose this is that when a sudden need to move is located in the environment through the cross reference of all of the senses, the hydraulic block that is the foveation of cardiovascular resources on the area/s of the central nervous system, needs to respond rapidly, in order to negotiate the movement of the person away from that location, or some other movement to respond successfully to the environmental change.  Thus there must be a reasonably rapid connection between the primary senses and the adrenal glands.  The ears are the ‘eyes in the back of our heads’, as every good teacher understands.  So, the ears are high in informational importance with regards to the resultant adrenal hydraulic block change, due to some detected environmental change, an important survival measure.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When age or some other condition sets in, some set of hairs that are all a similar length can be affected, and the result is tinnitus.  Tinnitus can be faked through the use of the mosquito effect, where teenagers can consciously report a high frequency sound, that is annoying enough to move them on from playgrounds and other civic areas during the night, but the mosquito effect, I have observed, also affects adults, particularly when they are delibidinised (a condition that affects me, due to some thieves – appendix C).</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0">	I have earlier stated that hormonal presentation, in the form of that hormonal profile that escapes from us as sweat, a phenomenon commonly known as pheromonal, is a measure both of our physical ‘shape’ and the relative balance of hormones i.e. our current body state.  When that body state presents our shape with an erection in it, to some other, then the other’s mimetic process of identification will draw them into an aroused state also.  That the hippocampus, amygdala, and the limbic system generally <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">resemble</span> a penis, is perhaps why the pheromonal presentation of individuals can suddenly demonstrate this aroused shape to one another, i.e. the shape is a bias that stems from evolutionary repetition of ‘thermodynamic’ neural process, that is selected for due to its success in the process of affording success of intention when making sexual advances.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">The importance of those brain structures, the hippocampus and the limbic system have for emotional body state, might suggest that the morphology of those brain structures has a resulting consequence in terms of sympathetic neural activity at the other end of the neural system.  <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Similarly, the shape of those</span> brain structures, where the amygdala looks a little like the bulbous end of a penis, and the hippocampus the stem, may well have hydraulic consequences on the cardiovascular hydraulics that then affects the resultant pheromonal presentation of the individual, encouraging arousal in some other.  As I mentioned above, function dictates form in terms of evolutionary shaping of anatomical structures, and so the morphology may have arisen as part of its successful function in affording sexual arousal.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> The vagus nerve, which, in tying the different organs together neurally, has the artefactual consequence (since its primary function is to indicate the arrival of food) of being capable of presenting complex body states to the central nervous system as part of a continuously co-varying, exogenous environment that is internal to the person and, as I mentioned above, thus of great importance in recall as a constraint on that recall.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">By the way, is it that there are seven principle organs, that we have arrived at the idea that there are seven discriminable emotions?  I’m relatively certain that that is an old idea, perhaps classically Egyptian, and that there are herbs for the organs that correspond to the health of the organs, as demonstrated by the emotions.  I seem to recall reading that at some point.  If you know, then let me know, please.  I’m a great fan of herbal remedies.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 9:</span> <a id="a9Drivetheory"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">Drive theory</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It might seem superfluous to describe, within the scope of a definition of consciousness, the notions from that pre-war school of thought called drive theory, but as I will discuss, consciousness does not imply free will.  I use the term drive loosely, and with only partial applicability in reference to the modern human.  I hope to describe, instead, some proto-human, in a pre-modern evolutionary form, in fact in every pre-modern evolutionary form, right back to the first life form that felt hunger, and perhaps before.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The drive, is more completely stated as 'drive resolution'.  In the early evolutionary shapes that our species once habited this planet in, we would record neurally, the movement away from a food source.  That neural movement would be our 'memory' of how to locate the food, unwinding backwards, once similar features of the environment occurred, to the point at which we located the food source, and ate.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Think slugs.  We almost certainly share a certain amount of our genetic morphology with slugs, since we have two proto-eyes.  One is the pineal gland, still light sensitive, and the other is the olfactory bulb.  For that reason, I christen our species 'monkey slugs'.  After all, who decided we should be called humans?<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn4" id="bodyftn4">4</a></span>.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, the slug that we were, located food by unwinding its movements from salient features of the environment, i.e. those physical features that stood out from the background but that had a high enough information content, in terms of both their discriminability from other features, and also past experience about those features coinciding with successful location of a food source.  This process, became more and more complex, allowing greater freedom from the environment, by establishing ever more salient features with even higher information content that would allow us to locate food.  What else did we need to locate?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Reproduction.  Why?  Because when we reproduce, there is a greater chance of food being located: many hands make light work.  Food first, sex later.  The first question.  Dinner.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What I hope to introduce to you here, is that we are no longer, for the greater part, slugs.  We have continued to arrive at greater and greater complexity of perceptual resolution of drive, with more and more salient features until we have arrived at a sufficiently abstract relationship with our environment to become something recognisable as a discrete mammalian form, although probably much, much earlier than that, perhaps before we left the sea.  I will give a potted history of evolution, with some insights into its occurrence in chapter 34, when I discuss what happens to our ‘consciousness’ after death.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is here, at that complex resolution of drive, that I locate the crunch of consciousness.  When referring to consciousness, people often consider that some internal narrative, thought, is the defining feature. However, consciousness can be characterised in a far broader scope.  Any individual life form that can respond to a stimulus, whether it is touch, sound or communicative gesture like language, perhaps, can be considered to be conscious.  Often a self willed action is mistakenly dubbed evidence of consciousness.  Free will can be a mysterious thing to discern in other life forms, since sometimes it is not obvious how they might display such a characteristic.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In many cases, it simply isn't necessary to have self willed actions, certain types of amoeba for example.  In other lifeforms it is not obvious that what we might classify as a self-willed action is actually evidence of free-will.  Such discussions are the subject of philosophy, though, which has argued over just about every nut and bolt of consciousness without ever properly defining how it might be realised.  That is the ginormous step that I am attempting to take here, attempting to realise the device, the machine, through construction of a model, before attempting a definition.  That way round of doing things.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So the post munch slug that we were once, slithered its slimy way across the salient features of the environment, recording them until it had recorded a sufficient amount of salient features to be able to discriminably relocate the food source once it slithered and slimed across the same configuration of salient features. And we, modern humans, are still doing that now.  With a little less slithering and sliming, unless we are politicians.  We have invented a whole host of rituals of behaviours to intervene between the drive to locate food and the resolution of that drive.  We need to put on clothes to leave home, we need to find the money to take with us, we need to ask others, if there are any, etc. etc. etc. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I employ a term that I have coined, recursive re-description, to describe this complicated resolution.  It describes the process, recursive, and the consequence, re-description.  It is recursive, i.e. it repeats its form as it grows from the inside out, repeating its structure, in a way that can be thought of in the same conceptual picture as the way that a fractal might repeat its patterned form at greater sizes, preserving the distances between its constituent features.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This is important, I think, since the neural process of muscular motivation is, in my opinion, an example of fractal amplification, the same amount of power being transmitted in an amplified manner, which would both allow the conceptualisation of the way in which neural complexes can have precise control over resultant gross limb movements, and also hints, at least to me, at the way in which the 'shape' of the underlying process of neural activity can affect the 'shape' of causally distant but resultant behavioural features.  Not the best description of what I mean, but there are other examples, which will hopefully obviate this fact that our physiological environment comes to display underlying neural behaviour as an artefact.  There is an example from behaviourist studies, in which a particularly complex associative rule, observed as a set of contingencies in the behaviourist manner, was demonstrated to exist at the neural level.  Also, as I have mentioned in the previous chapter, brain morphology may reflect neural activity, or its functional consequence and vice versa.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">My analysis of ‘drives’ treats them as attentional constraints, where those constraints on attentional process are biases that strongly bias the direction in which our thoughts <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">are directed</span>.  I point to the importance of the underlying ‘food drive’, seeing it as primary, but when I first started examining these issues, I was struck by the fact that the principle drives that seem to underlie attentional resolution, were the food drive, the libidinal drive, and intellectual drive.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One day, I realised that these could be characterised as ‘the father (who results in the finding of food), the son (the result of the libido i.e. reproduction) and the holy ghost (the intellectual ‘drive’)’.  I eventually uncovered a long history of modern religions being related to the use of materialist psychology as hypnotic bias on the resulting society, observed under the rubric idealism perhaps; the subject of some book that I shall write in the future perhaps.  However, here, I want to examine the idea of a reproductive drive, and then look at the intellectual drive.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">SEX, proclaimed Sigmund Freud, loudly.  He did so in Vienna, a popular holiday destination at the time, known throughout Europe, and importantly, at a time, when the discussion of sex and sexuality was virtually banned in upper class society.  The result was a traumatised latter day Victorian society and a greatly, rapidly changed Edwardian culture.   As a consequence, perhaps, of that bias on the initial circumstances of the developing complex field of scientific study, the concept of reproduction has taken an overly emphasised role in the sciences, with many of them seeing a drive toward reproduction as a primary feature of human existence.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I doubt that it is that important, personally, seeing it as secondary to the acquisition of food.  We, the human species, are scavengers, before we begin farming, and as so, in that very long era of evolutionary advantage where we were hunter gatherers, we became shaped by evolutionary processes in a particular way. When food is scarce, we show a tendency to procreate more.  This leads to us having a greater amount of in-group members that will be able to scavenge for food.  So, in modern society, one tends to associate large families with poverty, and, I suggest, this is because there exists an evolutionary prerogative to have more children when food is scarce.  So, this is why I ‘reduce’, sort of in the sense of ‘reductionism’, the libidinal drive to the food drive.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The intellectual drive is that process of drive that is realised in the Central Nervous System, intra-cranially.  It is the activity of resolving the different neural assemblies that are firing at any given moment, and is where we might locate some mechanism for ‘free will’.  I examine the philosophically interesting suggestion of free will in a later chapter, but <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">for the moment, concentrate on</span> recursive re-description.  At each stage of re-describing the initial drive, there is a little extra redundancy introduced, to the extent that eventually, humans were able to engage in the process of abstraction.  They were able to abstract their immediate drives away from the environmental stimuli that caused those drives, and were able to control their responses.  However, at the base of the recursive re-description that is the overarching process of selection of behaviour lies the food drive.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I want to eat.  So, because I am a modern human, I generally have to go to a shop or a restaurant to eat, and I prefer to wear clothes.  I need the money to pay for the food when I get there and I need to consider the fashion statement and appropriateness of the clothing that I am going to wear.  All of these different steps have underlying, macro steps that are necessary, and it is the summation of all of these things that holistically speaking are the activity of the self.  At the base, though, of all directed activity is the food drive.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As a digression, the importance of the food drive for cognition has played a part in the development of our environmental awareness.  There are, across Europe and further still, tumuli, where neolithic peoples have moved extremely large stones some distance before erecting them as a framework, and covering them in earth.  We have a particularly well preserved example in the form of La Hougue Bie, in Jersey, where I live.  It is generally suggested that these tumuli are passage graves or sacred sites.  I am more inclined though, to believe that they are fridges.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Early man lived in caves, where fish, and dairy products would have been preserved to some extent by the cold environment of the cave.  When the tide raised in height, the people had to move to higher ground, away from the coast.  The tumuli that they then built, are the relocated environment of the cave in order to keep the food fresh.  They are aligned towards the rising sun of the solstice, because those people did not have fire to light their way inside, and on that day, they engaged in cleaning the ‘cave’.  Eventually though, salt preservation and pickling became the norm with regards to food preservation, with the advent of the spread of the beaker people.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The reason that I mention this here, is that it is quite likely that the importance of the food drive to cognition has left these ancient storerooms, abandoned as they were, later being interpreted as ‘sacred sites’.  A digression, I know, but I’m interested, since it displays a great deal of lack of understanding of the practical nature of the laziness of man, to imagine that they would drag huge stones across large distances to lever them into place, purely for the sake of worship.  The church roof came far later, long after the fridge.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">My point though, is to remark on the importance of the food drive in cognition generally, and its impact on the way in which our cognitive organisation is managed.  It is the activity of the colon, that sees the colonic contractions forcing serotonin, in the digestive chyme, down towards the adrenal glands, where it is then forced through into the nephrons of the kidneys, before being ejected into the cardiovascular system.  When we are hungry, I am guessing, the contractions are more powerful, to try and ‘squeeze’ as much serotonin as is possible from the gut into the adrenals.  I am going to suggest that that follows from the observation that across the many billions of times that we were hungry, when evolving through the many forms before extremely recent human, with its hunger satiated by the local supermarket, that we had to muster the adrenally powerful state of being that allowed us to hunt successfully.  Perhaps, if that is correct, then occasional fasting is good for mental acuity?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 10:</span> <a id="a91Cognitiveeconomy"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">Cognitive economy</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Cognitive economy is a term from the cognitive sciences that refers to the very powerful influence on our behaviour that sees our cognition being biased by a powerful constraint – that which constrains towards the minimisation of the expenditure of cognitive resources.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Stake, the psychological concept that describes the amount of effort that we have already expended on some direction as a bias on our later reasoning, is certainly related to cognitive economy.  Where we have invested a reasonable amount of stake in arriving at some opinion, the stake that we have invested becomes involved with a calculation that maintains that opinion, if the gain from refuting it outweighs the effort that we put into establishing that opinion, i.e. the stake.  Where the gain is less than the already expended effort, denial is often the consequence.  This rather poorly detailed description is intended to convey the importance of a good comprehension of cognitive economy, since it is cognitive economy that is the calculation as to whether potential gain outweighs established effort, and <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">affects the decision of</span> whether or not to invest that effort.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Where I mention drives, with regards to the recursively re-described food drive, I can include cognitive economy as a drive in its own right, although treating it as a constraint is probably more useful.  I mentioned earlier that trauma can occur at the neural level, describing the outline of objects to the neural assemblies of perception.  Cognitive economy at the level of the neural assemblies is undoubtedly a powerfully important descriptive term for the process of resolution of drive that is neural sublimation, or drive resolution.  Cognitive dissonance is another term that can apply at successive levels of description, both neural and behavioural, that is an important process.  The term cognitive dissonance describes a state of stress experienced by the individual where the individual holds two or more incongruent beliefs.  The fight/flight complex can be thought <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">as isomorphic of </span>cognitive dissonance.  But lower than that, at the level of neural representation, cognitive dissonance can describe the state that neurons find themselves in when meeting some low level feature of the environment that interrupts their functioning.  It is important to recall that because of the fractal amplification of power by the neural system to the musculature, there are likely to be these isomorphic relationships between low level neural structures and overt physical behaviour.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As neural activity reduces towards a resting potential as some neural complex sublimates some concept, that surface that is described by the diminishing amount of firing across time, can be pictured as a slope, the gradient of descent, in connectionist terms.   The move downwards towards less firing can be thought of as cognitive economy in action, the formation of neural complexes through neural sublimation.  There is an observed phenomenon in connectionist studies where the dissipation of energy of firing of neurons in the connectionist network find themselves halting before reaching the most efficient resting place.  It is described in connectionist studies as ‘the problem of local minima in gradient descent’, something I briefly described in chapter 6.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Imagine a ball rolling down a hill. The ball is the neural energy diminishing.  The ball finds its way into a trough, that is higher than the base of the potential energy dissipation resting place.  In other words, the ball could travel further, to be more cognitively efficient, but it gets ‘stuck’, the network detects the fact that any further travel will mean going upwards, and so it becomes convinced that it has reached the base resting potential.  </p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">The problem of local minima in gradient descent is interesting from a variety of different angles within materialist psychology, potentially.  In the case of neural sublimation, for instance, the maintenance of some neural complex might be described as the point at which sublimation stops, and that might be considered a ‘local minima’.  From the point of view of mental health, some condition or other might be the consequence of some process of dissipation of energy that has become ‘stuck’ at a local minima.  </p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">Have you ever experienced a state of nervous tension where, when you draw a breath,  the breath wavers as though it is pausing and becoming a series of smaller breaths?  Well, I wonder if there are at that time a lot of neural complexes that are stuck in formation, unable to resolve completely.  This leads me to <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">suggest</span> the idea that perhaps if a sublimating (forming) neural complex becomes stuck, and unable to continue reducing the amount of resources that it is using, then perhaps it spawns into existence as a bias, isomorphic neural constructs that then become biases on the initial sublimating concept, pulling it until it’s stuck potential snaps, and it continues to sublimate to some useful state of resting potential.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, in the context of cognitive economy, drive resolution can be thought of in terms of the way in which the neural system is continuously attempting to achieve cognitive economy.  The point of life: to relax.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 11:</span><span style="font-size:24.0px"> </span><a id="a900Attentionandmemory"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">Attention and memory</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Hold your breath!!</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">With the attentional influence of the adrenal release into the cardiovascular space adjusting the viscosity and hydraulic end point of the innervated and oxygenated blood, if we want to concentrate then we need a reliable continuously homogeneous supply of that innervated and oxygenated blood. This is, I suggest, why we hold our breath when we want to concentrate.  If we take a breath, then the oxygenation of the blood supply occurs.  The enriched blood then over feeds the neural complex, and then the kidneys are forced to adjust their release of mineralocorticoids.  This is, at first, an imprecise activity, although improving rapidly, and the consequence is the focus of blood in the brain wobbling, and thus attention wobbles.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Attention, or the act of concentrating on a piece of information, or some external object, in both cases implies that adrenal circuit that I mentioned earlier.  A hydraulic block is formed that immediately effects the centre of pressure of blood in the CNS.  Prior to this suddenly formed hydraulic block is the adjustment through mineralocorticoid release, of the metaphorical distorted surface of pressure distribution at the cross section of the ascending arteries (artery if you have only one kidney), that leaves the blood finding its way through the complicated morass of intra CNS veins, to the area that needs to be ‘foveated’ in the cardiovascular sense.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When the cardiovascular pressure distribution is correct, a sudden release of mineralocorticoids is released into the artery, such that that distribution is preserved, and reinforced, in terms of the maintenance of the endpoint on that area intra-cranially.  That sudden release, almost orgasmically for philosophers, is that sense of resolution, the ‘eureka’ moment.  This is the area, this eureka process, of resolution, that is worth concentrating on, in my opinion, with regards to mental health issues, all of which hinge upon to one degree or another, some problem with attention.   The eureka moment, occurs when the adrenals have been focusing for some period of time, and in the cases of people with mental health issues, their adrenal complex ‘gives up’ before that final moment of resolution has occurred.  I examine this suggestion later on when I reach the point of discussing ‘abnormal’ psychology.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Because attention is so fundamentally important to the process of human cognition, this book spends so much of its time referring to it, that it has the air of a health evangelist to it.  The human cognitive mechanism, in fact the human, is little else than a mechanism that can be described in terms of attentional process. Everything from free will to language comprehension, from mental health issues, to cancer, potentially, can be thought of in terms of attentional process.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Because the mechanism itself is not entirely complex, one has to overcome the notion that is so popular in science that complexity is equivalent to ‘good science’, and further overcome the idea that because this description concerns our selves at a fundamental level, it must be somehow complex and beyond reach of understanding, a myth put about by thieves, charlatans and pharmaceutical marketing departments.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Humour most often depends on attention, in the sense that attention is manipulated to one degree or another to effect humorous surprise in some paraprosdokian way, and friendships are borne out of similar senses of humour.  I suspect that people with similar attentional capacities flock together, an artefact of cognitive economy, in part, and that it is attentional capacity/style that is fundamental to the ability to decode and manipulate logic.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Furthermore, I greatly suspect that the majority of mental health service users find it difficult to 'integrate' with 'normal' society because their attentional systems are in a situation where they are 'out of phase' for whatever reason with the attentional systems of members of 'normal' society, at least this is a part of the reason.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Another reason for social isolation, that I think is important, is the pheromonal ‘profile’ of the person. This 'profile’, effectively to the neural system, a shape, reflects the hormonal differences; those hormones that are released as part of bodily function being present in sweat and other bodily vapour, such as that released at the sinuses.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Is that pheromonal profile outside of the norm, for your anticipated identity, or gender, class etc?  Then the anticipator, the other, has to work harder cognitively to process the event.  Cognitive economy then steers the other, the norm, away from the hormonally different person, rationalisations being dreamt up to support that avoidance behaviour.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I refer to people with similar attentional capacities, contingencies and expectations as sharing an attentional style, or being inclined towards an attentional field.  It is worth developing the notion of an ‘attentional field’.  An attentional field is some area of expertise that can be concentrated on, where it is described as an attentional field due to the possibility of discriminating it from some other area of expertise, and where it has internal coherency in a logical and linguistic sense – it has a structure.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">That structure requires attention to interact with it and what I am trying to describe with the notion of an attentional field, is that there can be two individuals who meet the same environmental circumstances but have different attentional experiences of that subject matter, so, rather tautologically, an attentional field is an environment that can be attended to, where the internal attentional features of that environment can, in some cases, lead to individually different attentional styles, individuals grouping together on the basis of their different processing of that environment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This description of an ‘attentional field’ can be useful in describing the consequences of some mental health conditions.  In sum, it examines that fact that ‘birds of a feather, flock together’, which I have pointed out with reference to humour, above.  It has another useful application.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If one examines the attentional expectancies of the writing style of Terence McKenna, or David Icke, one finds that they have a logical form, where logic can be thought of as demanding attentional analysis in a particularly discrete manner.  One can discriminate the writings of Mr McKenna or Mr Icke, from other, more ‘rational’ authors, by the loose logical requirements of the often ‘non-sequitur’ statements with their ‘flowery’ or perhaps ‘spiritual’ terms of reference that do not have the clear cut referential resolution that is typical of more scientific treatises.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">These types of statement are the type of statement made by a human neural system that is under a type of stress, one which it is resolving by selecting a type of catharsis of that stress, with the immediate resolution of the cardiovascular resources that the acceptance of non-sequitur and unclearly defined truths can allow.  I have found, in my experience, that people that are experiencing a certain type of psychological stress in their lives, select the writings of these authors.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I suggest that it is because the attentional style that they are practising in their conditions, usually schizotypal or the similar cannabis psychosis, is similar in terms of its underlying resolution of logical form, to the attentional field that is created by those authors.  Those psychotic individuals are directed by their own process of cognitive economy, towards those attentional fields, since it is there that they can relax most easily, because their attentional expectancies are more congruent with those attentional fields.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I think this is the case, although, at the same time, those attentional fields of the writing styles of those authors, have in them, a number of logical forms that in their rapid acceptance of sometimes not so acceptable conclusions, represent the facilitation of rapid resolution for the stressed cognitive system.  It is more than the constituent attentional strategies, though.  It is the entire body of work by those authors that makes an attentional field.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">People who have the ability to pay attention to detail, for example, are more likely to flock to the attentional field that is engineering, than they are to the loose definitions of esoteric writings.  Similarly, attentional fields identify jazz fans separate to heavy metal fans.  It is, the concept of an attentional field, a term that is of utility and one that I will return to in both a discussion of intelligence later on and will also use, I suspect, in discussions of mental health conditions.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When one wants to recall some piece of information, the process of concentrating cardiovascular resources begins, locating any neural ‘origin’ that leaves a sense of familiarity, due to the distal connections of the neural system to the organs of the body.  That internal environment, the bodily organs, is an environment that we carry around with ourselves, where its different configurations can be considered to co-vary with the external environment, allowing us to regain that bodily configuration, that then leaves us with the conscious feeling of familiarity, where that conscious feeling has occurred as a subconscious sense of familiarity long before it becomes conscious, if it does.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In any case the internal environment’s cue to recall that is elicited as the cardiovascular resources wash through the brain, then stimulates the neural origin that is eliciting that bodily response, which in turn, leaves the adrenals concentrating more and more powerfully on that area, and any other that increases the ‘sense of familiarity’ that is the awakening bodily state of the internal organs, that is part of the environment that we were in when we coded the ‘to be recalled’ information.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, as we begin to reconstruct the ‘shape’ of the internal environment, our cardiovascular/adrenal circuit is responding by pursuing any sense of familiarity, where sense of familiarity can be translated as the connections to other neural areas, and those other neural areas that were present and firing at the point at which we observed the ‘to-be-recalled’ object etc.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As I repeat in the chapter on dynamic systems theory, recall is the present time plus n amount of time.  In its inverse it makes more sense.  The present is memory at time 0. So, the process of recall or the process of flowing through the environment, both are processes involving attention.  Successful navigation of the experienced environment or the recalled one, involves defeating biases that would distract our attention.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Two different types of  bias on attention can be discerned.  Endogenous attention and exogenous attention.  Endogenous attentional biases are those that come from within, that could be referred to as willed actions.  Exogenous cues, attentional biases, are those that are external to our free will, that ‘capture’ our attention, which is then forced automatically to locate itself upon the exogenous cue.  Many exogenous biases exist within our own bodily environment, both as sets of neurons in the CNS and also in the different configurations of neural ‘shapes’ of the bodily organs.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If I walk across my bedroom, not wearing any slippers, barefoot, and I stub my toe on some object, then that sudden trauma is going to leave an imprint on the recollected environment, such that when I next traverse the environment, my subconscious attention will focus heavily on that place where I stubbed my toe, which, under certain circumstances, may cause me to stub my toe again, although the general idea, I suspect, is that with attentional resources allocated heavily in that area, we are better able, in general, to make finely resolved movements around that area where the source of ‘danger’ might exist.  Exogenous biases can form due to experience, but they can also be endogenously created, or simply have some feature that appeals to the cognitive economic routines of the various proprioceptive organs, or perceptional ones, such as a shiny object to the retina.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">E</span>xogenous does not necessarily mean ‘external’.  The continuously co-varying environment of the totality of the physiological areas of the body, the neural system of the organs principally, are internal to the individual but can be considered as exogenous cues, potentially.  As the ‘intellectual drive’ resolves all the competing neural assemblies, those that do not successfully compete for cardiovascular resources and dissipate, can be described as exogenous biases on, ultimately, human behaviour, via the attentional system.  I return to the subject of endogenous and exogenous biases on attention in the next chapter, on free will, where I state that freewill can be considered as the battle between endogenous and exogenous cues.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:24.0px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter 12:</span> <a id="a901Freewill"></a>Free will</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">And what of free will?  Free will has been one of the most hotly debated statements regarding our existence as humans, and consciousness generally.  In attempting to solve the problem, free will has been pitted against a notional polar opposite, determinism.  Compatibilists have emerged to state that the free will vs determinist argument is not a valid dilemma.  I do not involve myself in any philosophy of mind with regards to free will, instead examining how it might be possible in that extended neuro-cardiovascular system that is the human body.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If I had to locate the process of freewill as a tail on a donkey, I would mostly point at the enormous complexity that is a consequence of such a lengthy period of recursive re-description of that drive resolution complex.  Where the slug had simply to record its move away from the food source and unwind it in reverse, which might mean a series of directional vectors being played out, there are a vast amount of features and sub-features of necessary behaviour to play out as we locate and gather food, storing it for later consumption.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">At every successively evolved stage of re-description of the primary drive in terms of supporting behaviours, there is at least some systemic redundancy per stage, and the aggregative summation of the redundancy continues until, at some point in our evolution, we achieved a sufficiently abstracted version of environmental demands, in cognitive representation, to be able to arrive at the ability to inhibit potentiated actions.  That inhibition of potentiated actions, is the foundation of human free will. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Where the act of representing food once had perhaps 360 degrees of freedom, it now has billions of degrees of freedom.  This leaves any decision presented with a possible field of alternatives, that includes the below conscious awareness ‘shapes’ of the bodily neural systems, where that possible field of alternatives is constructed from millions or billions of different alternatives.  Those millions or billions of alternatives represent the many different neural states.  We are, with that many degrees of freedom, presented with a situation where our endogenous attention can mitigate the impact of exogenous cues on its path, through the neural representation of the exogenous cues as well as the endogenous.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is as though the neural system finds a common denominator of the both types of influence, exogenous and endogenous, and in taking that common denominator as the activation of individual neurons, it can dissolve the biases such that the power of exogenous cues is greatly diminished relative to endogenous cues.  There might be only one endogenous bias, perhaps the resolution of the desire to reach out and grab some feature of the environment.  There might be several exogenous biases on the achievement of that activity.  In bringing the entire neural system to bear down upon that action, the exogenous cues suddenly become far smaller than the endogenous cue.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">And that is free will.  More generally, as I state in the previous chapter, free will can be defined as the battle between exogenous and endogenous attentional biases. So, the more complex a life form, in terms of its social environment, and other environments generally, that it has evolved into, the greater amount of recursive re-description of the drives occurs, the greater amount of systemic redundancy exists at each stage and the greater amount of different biases exist at any given moment.  These biases are all complexes that can be considered as important constraints on the recall of information later, as they return to activation as the environment is recreated either just before it is the subject of immediate perception, or during an act of recall.  The more complex the animal is neurally, the greater chance it has at freewill.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As humans, we have exploited our opposable thumb to create a complex environment, and into that environment that we have created has spilled the sometimes overtly visible consequences of that fractal amplification of neural form that motivates the musculature.  This process means that the shape of our environment is even more powerfully adept at scaffolding our behaviour to the extent that we have free will through the increased amount of redundancy that is available due to the automaticity that is stimulated by the ‘shape’ of our external environment, whether it is the shape of hammer or some other tool, or the shape of buildings, with regards to the location of doors and windows.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So I locate free will as a sort of illusion that becomes real.  It is that drive resolution that is recursive re-description, but dissolved into the many millions of constituent steps that are necessary to locate food by the modern human.  The food drive is the initial drive that stirs, deep down in the subconscious, in the early hind brain.  As it does so, it stimulates the recursive re-description, that becomes the fractal amplification of the muscular process that is language, with the tongue inhibited, and that process of inhibition, leading to the dissipation of energy that was intended for it, spreading as patterns of activation towards the auditory cortex where the association of the tongue movements with the stimulated auditory cortex as we have repeatedly heard our voice and the voices of others, leaves the phenomenal percept of our voice; our thought.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Not everyone hears the internal self narrative that is evoked.  For some people, thought is continuously below their level of conscious awareness.  Often, I have observed, the people that I have met that do not hear their thought are working class people.  Perhaps it is some legacy of not having been involved in intellectual pursuits as families, or perhaps it is that they have always, generation after generation, had everything that they need, and have been entrenched in happy family life.  It may be an artefact of not spending as much time reading quietly, perhaps.  Perhaps, though, I haven’t asked enough members of some other socio-economic bracket to establish properly whether, by self report, they are aware of their sotto-voce.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Either way, I eventually achieved that wonderfully relaxed world, where I didn’t have to continuously listen to an inner dialogue, but not until I had experienced EMDR, a therapy that dissociates the environment from the source of trauma that I once experienced, and that I describe in greater detail later on.  After that point, after the EMDR, I reason, my thought was below the level of my conscious awareness.  Its not that I was without thought, simply that I was in a sufficiently relaxed state to not have to continuously listen to my internal self narrative.  It makes a lot of sense, since when we are in a fight/flight situation, we are effectively stuck between two states, states of mind (neural states) that are cognitively dissonant, irresolvable.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">At that point, of fight/flight, we are more aware of ourself, able to concentrate on the unfolding environment ahead, at the same time as concentrating on ourself, our person, inspecting for being hit by branches as we run, being bitten by the predator; we concentrate forwards and backwards at the same time. So, it might be suggested that those who hear their own thoughts are in a greater state of fight/flight, a state of greater cognitive dissonance.  Perhaps, heard thoughts are a consequence of the valour based society and its relatively continuous history of war and consequent trauma.  Or, more likely perhaps, they are a state of self inspection, in which we command our self.  Later, I describe language as a tool that we construct to manipulate others or the self as an extension of one’s own body, to obtain resolution of a drive.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In any case, as the neural subconscious representation of recursive re-description is unwinding in the hind brain, it is catching the neurons around and 'above' it, which are stirring and then the mechanism of the tongue and other speech effectors takes over.  The neural agency underlying this process of the construction of thought, like the process of free will that I described earlier, where the common denominator of the neuron leaves most exogenous cues swamped with a far greater endogenous representational set (of neurons), is in existence during the process of the production of language which, when the tongue movements are inhibited, is thought.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">T</span>he process of production of language involves the creation of many constraints that are effectively endogenous cues, in the form of the articles and other smaller parts of speech.  So, where free will becomes consciously apparent, is at that feature of our conscious existence, the self narrative of thought.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:24.0px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter 13:</span> <a id="a902Languageandthought"></a>Language and thought</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, I continue, after the nervous system, cardiovascular hydraulics, drive theory, a brief discussion of the role of attention and a cursory glance at free will, to examine that feature of human consciousness that I mentioned in the first chapter, on the subject of neurons.  Neural networks, that can be described as connectionist systems, do not directly address the outside world, but instead are translated through the mechanism of the intervening physiological effectors.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There is no neuron or set of neurons that represent any object in the outside world, but instead there are neural assemblies that represent the way we might interact with some object.  The firing of the assemblies that underlie the interaction, innervate the assemblies that underlie the visual or auditory percept of the object and we feel the familiarity, or can ‘picture’ the object in our minds, as the neural systems underlying the visual percept of the object are activated by the neural firing of the other, muscular-interactional neural assemblies that are connected distally to the neurons in the visual pathway.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As I described in the preceding section, thought is language, where the movement of the tongue is inhibited, along with other bits of the body implicated in speech production such as lungs, lips, epiglottis, diaphragm, vocal folds and other associated parts.  Also, one can state that language is thought, where the tongue is allowed to move.  I think it is important to take a closer look at the tongue, since it is perhaps a most important organ when considering consciousness, particularly in relation to good mental health.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The tongue is not one muscle but 6 muscles, bound together.  It is the most complex muscle in the body, able to describe with a great many degrees of freedom, a large amount of positions to the extent that a large amount of discriminable sounds are possible with clarity.  All the other muscles in the body have two degrees of freedom, they stretch or relax, perhaps, in fact, it is only one degree of freedom, stretch/relax being one state of existence.  Either way, the tongue is so complex, that, in my opinion, much if not all of the neocortex has evolved to accommodate the fine motor control of the tongue.  Why might this be?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The answer is that the tongue needed to achieve a greater lexicon of sounds than it had at its disposal; a sudden change of environment created that need.  That sudden change of environment was most likely the sudden requirement to live together in close proximity as disparate family groups.  Though this most likely included some form of drought, I suspect that the post ice age flood waters of the melting ice, caused widespread flooding, leaving small communities of disparate family groups sharing small islands.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This was most likely at around the end of the time in our history when we were australopithecine.  Up to this point, we had lived in separate family groups, much like modern monkeys do currently.  Then when suddenly thrust into the forced-by-circumstance company of unknown others, the small lexicon of sounds, in conjunction with pheromonal and other non-verbal communication cues, were simply not enough to negotiate the problems of living in close quarters with others.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the case of ancient ancestors, modern monkeys or modern humans, there are a set of behaviours that are primed,  with neural activity capable of resolving the completion of such and such a behaviour being potentiated at the sight of some object that can be interacted with.  The basic response that can then be fired to complete the action, remains potentiated for some period of time, until some action, such as REM sleep, or conversation (since so much of the modern brain has evolved as an aid to language), ‘pops’ the potentiated neural complex and the  neural activity’s potentiation dissolves, although ‘resolves’ would probably be a more precise descriptive term.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When we came together as australopithecine humans, we found ourselves in such close proximity that we had to develop the ability to restrain ourselves from reaching out and grabbing the food from the hands of others, thus developing the ability to gain a greater level of ability to inhibit automatically potentiated activity.  How, and why?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Here is a putative how.  The hind brain or some early part of the neocortex, calculates the immediate response containing the potentiated neural complex, and in order to prevent that response becoming observable behaviour, the continuously amplifying neural activity at some origin (what I refer to as the neural origin), spills out, away from the neural connections that would see behaviour instigated, and dissipating, maintaining some aspects of its form as it does, the neural activity spreading outwards from somewhere in the hind brain towards the outer edge of the neocortex.  As it spreads out, exciting neural potentials, it completes its path of excitation when it reaches the edge of the neocortex, and from then on the continuous excitation carries on exciting that already activated pathway, with the same law of thermodynamics related to the potential of neurons to maintain activity, dictating where new neural structures occur, in that way that I mentioned in the beginning of this book, in the section on neurons.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Perhaps, if there is no connection, then if the acidity occurs regularly enough with a proximal neuron proving to be useful in lowering acidity levels, then a dendrite begins to form.  I would suggest that it might be the case that if that neural pathway that is excited regularly enough, perhaps as part of a process of inhibition, and the release of planned neural amplification, then the emerging dendrite, emerges, eventually a neural nucleus, to eventually describe a new neuron.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In this way, the neural activity that is excess to the needs of the continued inhibition of the physical activity, spreads out into the neocortex, defining new neurons where the activity is potentiated but inhibited.  This process creates a greater ability to define a greater complexity of external stimulus, through the development of increasingly greater degrees of freedom, as constraints, which emerge as inhibition.  This then leaves the neural representations of some activity or other as the ‘negative image’, i.e. the constraints on that activity, rather than some neural complex that defines the activity.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0">The neural activity dissipates into the neocortex, in order to inhibit movement.  Once it reaches the edge, it ‘reflects’ such that activate pathway has more energy than it can contain, potentially.  If that activated pathway occurs enough, or stands out from the background in some useful way,  i.e. is a salient feature of that environment, sufficient to be useful in constraining some other behaviour, then the increased ‘acidity’ of waste from the excess neural activity forms new dendrites and eventually new neurons.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, living in a close group, with different families in close proximity, as some member of another group walked past, carrying some fruit or other item, the need to inhibit potentiated grasping movements became more important.  We were most likely primed to grab foods or other things with automaticity because we had been, until recently, swinging in the trees, where automaticity of response is certainly necessary.  Also, I would suggest that food began to be delivered at some regular interval, during the day.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Perhaps the drought that forced us together, left us hunting at a particular time of the day, perhaps because a hunted prey was only available at a particular time of day.  The reason for making this suggestion, is that it is only when food is repeatedly presented at the same time of day, that the diurnal rhythms become capable of representing a forewarned neural system, and so, at a particular time of day, before the food arrived, digestive juices began to flow.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This increased amount of saliva, in comparison to any time before, when demands for food were met immediately, along with the inhibition that it may have taken to live together with foreign beings, in close proximity, may have allowed for a more viscous cardiovascular system, and with the increased pressure on the development of the cranium, it had the capacity to expand.  Darwinian selection pressures then leave the beings that have a greater ability to inhibit behaviour, controlling automatically potentiated activities, being favoured, and the neocortex begins to increase in size. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is also true that an important part of language, in fact cognition generally, is the ability to make predictions, and in moving from hunter gatherers, scavenging from our environment continuously, we changed to a circumstance where we had fixed times for eating and this meant that our bodies would have begun to anticipate the arrival of food by preparing digestive juices in advance.  This novel circumstance, where we had to wait for our food, is the point, I suspect, at which our capacity to predict and our enjoyment of the resolution of successful prediction began.  Aside from prediction, and perhaps the most important part of language, if one can consider it a part, since it is the whole really, is the notion of abstraction.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">With an increasing amount of distance between the proclaimed desire and the resolution of that desire, on a repeated basis, when in a multi family society, the process of abstraction begins.  We were no longer able to reach out to our hearts content and take whatever we wanted.  Planning and shared hunting, and the communication necessary for success, have been suggested, but I put it down to some other factor, more physical, in that the growth of the neocortex, achieves a point at which we are able to move fast enough intellectually, in our resolution of understanding, to have spare attentional resources.  These attentional resources were then expended on the process of constraint of attention, fixating it neurally, through inhibiting its progress as the energy dissipated throughout the neocortex.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I consider that one of the most likely points at which we developed language was when our neocortex had the facility to change, to support the development of abstraction etc.  If we look at differences between modern humans and that form that most likely preceded us evolutionarily, prior to hominid evolution, monkeys/apes etc, we see that there are big differences in both distribution of hair, and the fact that we, humans, stand upright. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The standard explanation that I know of regarding us standing up straight as a species, is that we were forced to leave the environment of the forest/jungle, and then to move across the plains, where there was an advantage for us if we stood upright; we could see predators more rapidly.  I think it much more likely, though, we changed to an upright standing position due to a sudden and enduring flood.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This would leave us with the water supporting our developing standing position, forcing us to stand up straight, in order to hold our head above water.  Whether or not the presence of water affected us having hair or not, is difficult to appreciate.  I can’t see how it might have been realistically, but at some point we lost our hair.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Perhaps, I might suggest that in the post ice age environment, there was a sudden flood, and we were forced to live on a series of small islands, moving between them in order to locate food.  The hair loss may well be alopecia from the stress of being forced to live in close proximity to one another, despite coming from different family groups, but that hair loss might offer some evolutionary advantage in swimming.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the case of the development of language, we can see the way in which the neonate develops, intra-natally, the neural system sufficient to be able to move, as the process of neural development occurs, and then, when it is born, its neural development continues, gaining continuous improvements on constraining its movement, in the form of balance.  As the drive for food develops, the neurons between the stomach and the tongue developing to the extent that the tongue will inform, as an emergent memory from the pattern of excitation of its taste buds, the colon on how to prepare for the coming food.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As the partly dissolved food passes through the intestines, it sits at places in the colon, the capacity for that food to osmose, at that position, allowing the nutrients to pass through the lining of the colon.  The lining of the colon, I suspect, represents the osmosis of the food into the blood stream, with different foods dissolving at different rates, but at least some hegemony of the order of osmosis occurs, to the extent that the arrangement of descending colon and the different areas of it that represent the different nutrients, forms a chain of continuously presented information that the brain can consider as an environment that it is passing through.  This allows the adult human the opportunity to treat certain foods as environmental triggers to behaviours, whilst the neonate begins to learn to concentrate, and eventually, gains the ability neurally, to differentiate the different ‘environments’ made up by the osmosis of nutrients from eaten food, to the point at which greater levels of endogenous attention are possible in the infant.  That is because they now have a co-varying exogenous environment that can serve to anchor attention.  At this point, potty training can begin and language emerges co-incidentally.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is only when the child reaches puberty though, that the adult attentional system begins to occur, with there being, I suspect, marked differences between pre pubescent and post pubescent attentional styles.  The big change for attention at puberty, is the relative size of the organs to one another.  The lungs grow at a rate, and there is more oxygen available for the process of healthy combustion and our attentional system begins to afford us a greater level of dissection of the attended to environment.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If one examines the development of the foetus intra-natally, one can see that it goes through a series of morphological stages in its development, that one might be able to state are the shapes that we had at earlier stages of evolutionary development.  This is defunct, as an idea, referred to as recapitulation theory.  Its famous pronouncement is that ‘ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny’, where our development reflects the shapes that we passed through in evolutionary earlier forms.   I am afraid that I continue to support the notion of recapitulation theory, considering the different forms during intra-natal development to be indications of the forms we had during our long era of evolutionary adaptation (EEA) periods, when our form stabilised.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I think that the shapes that we see in our developing forms are the periods of our prolonged state in one environment, where we faced an era of evolutionary adaptiveness.  To cut a long story short, I suggest that the period of puberty, the growth spurt from the age of 8 or 9 until the point at which we have stopped rapid growth at the age of 25 at roughly the latest, reflects a memory of that time when we were supported to stand upright and develop different physiological circumstances.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The hippocampus and amygdala is often compared, in its shape, to the shape of a seahorse.  Whilst a male seahorse gets pregnant, unlike a human, the many thousands of repeated generations that concentrated for hours to allow the female ovipositor to deposit the eggs, may have seen the selection for a penis at a later time in evolution.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">To return to the subject of language, there is a term that has been recognised by philosophers of language that is ‘intentionality’ or the ‘aboutness’ of something.  It is one of the fundamental axiomatic truths of my conceptual model of language production, and recognition, I guess, that intentionality, which could be held as approximately identical to the ‘meaning’ or ‘intention’ of a sentence, is approximately identical to the deictic resolution of some recursively re-described ‘drive’.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The word deictic is important to introduce, since it is related to the way in which reference occurs, between subject and object, with an internal neural representation of attentional contingencies being formed as the basis of what becomes the sentence. The word deictic refers to the act of pointing.  Deixis, the topic of ‘pointing’, is particularly important in language, since each word points, whilst each clause points, every sentence, made from words, and clauses, points at some thing.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Then there are paragraphs, brief conversational exchanges, that also point, and, ultimately, the entire conversation, that points at something.  One could generalise further, to the politic of the individual as framing the pointing act, I suppose.  The act of relating some statement to someone else, is the act of constructing an internal mental model that describes the attentional contingencies in terms of their deictic relations to one another.  The deixis of these different parts of language, arranged hierarchically as they are, are most likely constraints, and I would suggest that they occur as a consequence of the process of fractal amplification of power from neurons to observable behaviour, at the tongue and other parts of the speech mechanism.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">These deictic constraints then afford some ultimate impact on interpretation of meaning.  Observe that that fractal process of amplification of neural power to muscular movement, offers a vision of the hierarchical view of syntax.  And, I might extend, of recursive re-description.  The sentence has an initial ‘drive’ which it seeks to resolve as a whole, and the fractal process of attempting to meet the demands of internal, fractally expressed deixis, from word level deixis to paragraph level deixis and beyond, is effectively the process of recursive re-description.  It makes sense that we might retask existing structures to achieve new ends, as it is highly cognitively efficient, something that we are always driven to: cognitive economy.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is a rather cynical sounding statement perhaps, but I consider that all utterances are tools.  They are tools that we construct to obtain something from someone else. Sometimes, often, in fact, that someone else is ourself.  We have, as humans, developed an invisible prodding stick, to poke other humans and ourselves into being an extension of ourselves, for the sake of obtaining resolution, ultimately to a drive for, wait for it… food.  I think, though, that we use that invisible prodding stick to motivate ourselves as well, and that sotto-voce, is a conversation that we often use to steer ourself.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Analyses commensurate with ‘drive theory’ often find that there are many drives, three being the classic, the father, the son, and the holy ghost, metaphorical terms for the food drive, the reproductive drive and the intellectual drive.  I later considered those ‘drives’ as constraints on attentional process, before deciding that the food drive could subsume the other drives, which is where I stand now, in a manner of speaking, although I think it could be said that we create drives, i.e. resolvable neural complexes that drives us towards some end through a process of resolution of cognitive dissonance.  In the case of the food drive, human society has been created in the name of, and organised around the principle of, obtaining food.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What might be considered as a reproductive drive, is, as I stated in the chapter on drive theory, a physically realised part of that greater drive that is the food drive, something that we have done so often that we have developed special apparatus for conducting the safe resolution of that sub-section of the greater drive.  As scavengers, we have larger families when there is less food.  The need for food to be central is primary, driven by the terrible pangs of hunger, and rewarded, when having a larger family, by an increased chance of being looked after in one’s old age.  Reproduction as pension plan.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A particularly interesting part of understanding the materialist psychology of language stems from examining how comprehension of language works.  Analyses of language that were current, when I was at university, treated the neural system as some sort of frequency analysis machine, that somehow engaged in statistical feature detection to identify parts of words and then stitch them together in to a greater whole, before engaging in syntactic analysis.  It is, to some extent, this analysis of theirs, a consequence of the notion that ‘complexity’ equals ‘good science’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Hidden Markov models, a type of statistical analysis that was applied in a second stage analysis of the acoustic wave, unravelled by fast Fourier transform in to some constituent set of wave forms, was the computational standard, that seemed to be the yard stick to which psychological models aimed.  I had a different idea.  Along with much of the basis of the work I present here, in this book, my ideas were finished in some reasonably concrete way, when I was still at university.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I spent the last ten years of my life, after an 8 year period in which I was humiliatingly discredited and isolated, being interrogated, milked of every thought that I had ever had, particularly the insights that I present here.  I await the schadenfreude humour of the thieves when I present my insights, only to find that they have already written my ideas up in their own books.  Bummer.  Some you win, and some you lose, but it seems a shame that Britain is losing its academic wealth to some truly evil thieves.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Anyway, to return to language comprehension, I had a different idea.  My idea was bourne out by research, at least as I read it, and that is that the human ear meets the speech of an other, by the stimulation of neural activity to the pressure waves that set the hairs on the inner ear vibrating, and that the neural activity simply instigates the motivation of the neurons of the tongue muscles.  The tongue does not fire, unless, perhaps, in situations of echolalia, but the neurons underlying the tongue, model the tongue of the other.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As the tongue neurons of the listener trace out the tongue of the speaker, the constrained neural representations of words are stimulated and the listener ‘internalises’ the speech of others.  One of the features of this ‘scheme’ is that the listener is able to segment the audio stream into words, something that the bare audio wave analyses always struggle to achieve.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Syntactic analysis is that process by which, it is said, meaning is extracted from some heard, or constructed, sentence.  Often one sees the syntactic trees of Chomskyan generative grammar.  I am not of that camp, either.  I found some interesting critiques of generative grammar in a book on a subject called ‘radical construction grammar’ where those criticisms were based in real psychological insight.  I had come to look upon generative grammar as the post-hoc analytic tool of linguists, rather than anything psychologically real.  So, I examined what William Croft, was saying in his book, and since then have reasoned about the physiological reality of how the achievement of language production might occur.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I will repeat myself, again, here, but I still cannot formulate the process of language production in certain terms, needing to revisit some research, but roughly it is that the syntactic whole is the subclause, where this subclause is an emergent property of an underlying semantic model of deictic relations.  I consider that there might be some mileage in examining the sub-clause, and perhaps the clause, and paragraph in fractal terms, where the syntactic structure, the grammar, of the sentence is the patterned surface of a fractal.   Since the tongue, like any other muscle is receiving fractally amplified neural energy to motivate it in real time, at least I think so, then it is possible, as I stated above, that perhaps that the surface of the resulting produced shape, of the sub-clause, or clause, is fractal in nature.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Either way, in any conversational exchange, the producer is aiming to resolve some drive and the resulting conversation is a process of hammering out the resulting responsibilities with regards to the completion, the resolution of that drive.  This contract, whether it is with an other, or with the self, in an internal, sotto voce, is a battle, even when there is instant acceptance.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is the act of parley with a hierarchical relationship being established, even when it is in conversation between two egalitarians.  Some other analyses of language by theoretical neuropsychology have ignored the ‘other’ in analysing the act of speech.  I really don’t think, however, that there is really any time when there does not exist an ‘other’.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Since language is such an early part of our behavioural toolkit, or at least communication is, it is only fair to consider, I think, that some evolutionary earlier process than is available to us as humans is occurring.  Perhaps, I suggest, the way in which the retina resolves the image in to its constituent features, which, if it is an analogue of language comprehension, may be constituted of a set of behavioural interactions, is similar to language comprehension or production.  The resultant linguistic utterance is an attentional field, a field of vision effectively.  In that case, perhaps an earlier relationship in terms of intra-stream blood pressures may describe that form, or perhaps neural amplification of power to the musculature.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Referential deixis within language is interesting to examine in this context.  As I mentioned earlier, when one has a conversation, one is employing a whole raft of pointing actions.  Individual letters point at something, even if it is only a shape on a page.  Words are a form of referential deixis where all words point at something, even when they are parts of speech, rather than nouns and adjectives etc.  Then there clauses, made of words that point, and sentences, made of clauses that point, that are made of words that point. The sentences point at something or things, and a paragraph, which is made of pointing sentences, points at something or things, also.  Then there is the conversation in its entirety, which points at thing or things once again.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I hope that to you who have examined fractals, this sounds almost like a fractal structure, in the sense that the repeated pattern that is the ‘surface’ of the sentence, is repeating with some certain similarity, a perfectly similar pattern, only at a greater level than the similarly patterned constituent acts of deixis.  Fractal patterns are those that demonstrate self-replication of pattern at greater levels, and that stem as patterns from non-deterministic algebraic relations.  Since in choosing the utterances that make up the spoken sentence there are a whole host of decisions, which stem, presumably, from a non-deterministic relationship i.e. free will, this is part of where the fractal nature of the amplification comes from.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is amplification because it repeats its form at greater levels of expression, so perfectly that there is no loss.  I consider that there is a deterministic background for the experience of free will situations, relating those decisions back, via recursive re-description, ultimately to the resolution of a motivating food drive.  However, the resultant drive, recursively re-described, is described with such a great level of redundancy that it can be considered to effectively be non-deterministic.  There is so much room to move that we have many, many different ways to express ourselves, both in language and behaviour forms, but also in many other ways, beyond some posturing of one kind or another.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I am relatively certain that the underlying act of motivating the tongue muscles involves this form of fractal amplification of power, such that the neural states coincide in time, in what is a continuous system, with the resultant sounds, based on the muscular shapes of the tongue and other speech effectors.  That fractal amplification of power is isomorphic with the syntactic structure that has emerged as a consequence of its continuously coincident presentation with attempted utterances.  The rules of neuromuscular cognitive economy are the ‘cause’ of what looks like syntactic parsing trees.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This leaves the syntactic structure trees of generative grammar, a post hoc analysis that is the preserve of linguists, describing nothing of the brain except for some regularities of constraints on muscular ballistic calculations.  Each clause can be considered to be the linguistic resolution of referential deixis within an underlying ‘mental model’, a neural assembly.  The clause is seen in its entirety, with the words that form the clause occurring secondarily to the perception of the clause, where those words as they emerge are a constraint on the allowable completions.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Imagine a continuous system, that is a feedback loop between the neural form that is motivating the tongue, where that neural form is receiving feedback from the auditory cortex, and adjusting the muscles of the tongue to keep it on a path where its form will coincide with the other speech effectors for the sake of making a discriminable sound in the right place at the right time, and crucially, with the greatest amount of cognitive economy possible.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This is such a high stress situation that the neocortex, in its entirety, has developed to allow the rapid dissipation of overshooting energy that then allows the tongue to be controlled so finely.  Because it is a high stress situation, certain properties of the linguistic utterance occur that indicate properties of the system generally.  For example, short words that move from low energy requirement fricatives toward harsh plosive phonemes are used to describe statements of high stress.  Shit!  Really?  Fuck.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In many languages, it is worth examining irregular verbs, in order to see a cross language regularity occurring, in the sense that the regular verbs are events that don’t happen so regularly and don’t require the same high attentional effort that the irregular verbs are describing.  Their irregularity is a consequence of the fact that they need to stand out to the cognitive system, so they don’t stabilise as verbs into the same predictable-with-ease forms, instead demanding that we ‘wake up’ and start paying attention.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Ultimately, what I am proposing is that some entire scene is constructed as a unit of language that is complete before one starts engaging in the utterance, to the extent that the seemingly serial nature of its construction is actually just an artefact of the fact that it is has to be communicated in that form.  All represented brain states are represented in all underlying neural representations of modalities, acting as constraints on the emergent ‘shape’ of the sentence, where the sentence is identical to a scene, i.e. a visual scene is to the visual system what a sentence is to the linguistic system. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is a type of Piagetian constructivism, that acknowledges that there only exist in the brain, neurons for representing musculature, or perceptual ‘image’ whether it is visual, haptic, or smell.  As all modalities of representation always, no matter what is represented, excite neurons responsible for linguistic utterances; there exists in our subconscious, as we visually scan a scene in front of us, the potentiation but inhibition of all the linguistic descriptions of parts of that scene, in terms of the potentiation of neural structures that subserve linguistic utterances capable of describing those parts.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, unlike the claims made by Chomskyan theorists, there are no ‘rules’ or ‘rule sets’ in the brain.  It is akin to pointing out that there are no neural assemblies in the brain that contain, or look like, a strawberry.  The only neurons that exist in the brain are neurons that fire coincidentally to the extant behavioural act, where we have learnt, through a process of abstraction, to inhibit the act.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So there are perceptual neurons in the visual pathway that fire to represent the colour and shape of a strawberry, that fire coincidentally to a connected set of neurons that fire to represent the movements of the arm and hand and fingers to describe the shape of the strawberry, and there are also the connected tongue movement neurons that fire in a pattern that represents the sound of the word strawberry, whilst connected auditory cortex neurons fire to give us the auditory sensation of the word (where the ‘word’ is a collection of tongue movements and other speech effectors) ‘strawberry’.  The totality of all of this neural firing amounts to our internal concept of a ‘strawberry’.  In inhibiting the behavioural act, we don’t need the strawberry to be present, to describe it, so, successful abstraction.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, there are no learnt rules or rule sets.  There are only the neurons underlying the speech effectors and the neural assemblies that these awake in the extended musculo-skeletal and hormonal assembly.  As an analogue, imagine flowing through the physical environment.  As we flow through that environment, something I will describe in more detail in the next chapter, our neural assemblies that can interact with that environment are potentiated, and inhibited unless a successful interaction with that environment sees us activating those potentiated neurons.  Language is the same.  As we flow through the environment of language we potentiate different sets of tongue movements (I mean to suggest all of the speech effectors, and use tongue movements as a short hand for that).  These tongue movements are potentiated by the language we are creating, as well as the imaginal environment that we are attempting to express.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">At all points, cognitive economy must be the principal bias, and it is here that I suspect one can find international language differences, bound by a similarity, which is the requirement for cognitive economy with regards to the expensive production of linguistic form.  In other words, our tongue wobbles out the sounds that are the easiest to make in any situation, and national language differences grew out of different initial conditions.  The notion of affordances is worth examining in this concept, where one behavioural movement potentiates others that are afforded by that uttered sound that is the behavioural movement.  When producing the phrase, ‘the bottle is on the table’, the word ‘bottle’ is reached and the neuro-muscular constraints on the emerging sentence afford a subset of language that is able to be expressed in the next position, where this subset is constrained further by the to be described imaginal visualisation of the scene.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">That cognitive economy is a major part of the underlying process of language production is exemplified by the corpus of language that is the language of the working classes.  Currently, and for the last few generations, the working classes have not been as intrinsically involved within Christianity, at least some majority of them in Britain.  The result has been that their choice of language is often unregulated by cultural mores, and the consequence is that the words they choose to use have become shorter, and more guttural.  They are able to express any situation that they need, and with far greater cognitive economy, importantly, since they are often dealing with far higher levels of stress than the upper and middle classes.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Those upper and middle classes, find themselves in a situation, on the other hand, where like the working classes, a token of membership is the language that they use. Specialisation is the norm for the aspiring middle or upper class individual, as they attempt to achieve membership of a profession, and so their language is characterised by long, complex, poly-syllabic words.  If there were no regulation, and their language were left isolated from forms of control or manipulation, then cognitive economy would drive their vocabulary towards shorter words.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The fashion for poly-syllabism, by the way, is something that I think has become the norm since the beginning of the industrial revolution, with, in particular, the presence of Queen Victoria, and later Queen Elizabeth, and the great change in empowerment both politically and socially, of women, in society, leading to poly-syllabism.  I think that language may have been characterised by a relatively larger amount of series of short stabbing type words, prior to the 19<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span> century, since it was almost exclusively a patriarchal domain in terms of principal influences.  Poly-syllabism may emerge when female power is due, due to the more holistic cognitive style of women, or perhaps it is some feature that exists due to some Freudian process, the nature of oral sexual foreplay subconsciously sparking the drive towards many tongue movements. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Some greater observer of human nature than myself, then, coined the phrase ‘cunning linguist’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Aside from my rather puerile and desperately chauvinist observation, I have been able to notice application of this conceptual view of language that I present in this chapter.  One of these concerns the great change in information intake that has been the norm over the last 50 years as increasing amounts of people swap reading for television.  These people obtain their information in a visual and auditory manner and this employs different sets of muscle requirements to those use in information intake when reading. When reading, there has to be a fine level of control over the extra-occular muscles.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I have personal experience of this.  I had stopped reading, more or less completely before I took an A-level in Psychology as a pre-cursor to taking the degree in Psychology.  I found, quite a common observation, that I could read a page, and despite mouthing the sentences internally, I wouldn’t have taken in any information in any meaningful way.  It was often observed, in discussion with friends, that often one might finish a paragraph, and despite having read it, would have taken none of the intended meaning of that paragraph.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, reasoning, in a nascent materialist manner, I wondered if the eye needed to pause for some length of duration sufficient to allow the fixation of a word the opportunity to achieve meaningful contrast of the features of that word.  So, I spent a lot of time, reading pages of text, in the slowest way imaginable.  I would pause every time I had made an eye movement, and ask myself if I had moved to an appropriate position in order to continue to deduce, additively, the meaning of the text.  I paused fixating each word, for long enough to achieve a certain contrast, something like a second or two, an age when reading.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">After about a month, I was able to read and comprehend text and after two months of this I was able to read text and take in the meaning without missing anything, and to the extent that I could have spare time to think about the consequences.   It was almost like the type of hand eye co-ordination that develops when regularly practising guitar.  One eventually finds that one has spare time to reason about which direction to take when improvising, despite playing at a particularly fast measure.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I recently applied for a voluntary position teaching English to students at GCSE level, who required extra help, often due to being second language English speakers. Whilst I wasn’t able to take up the position, I was interested to learn at the interview that the students often could read entire bodies of text, without ever being able to take in the deduced meaning of that text.  I suspect that the increasingly observed incidence of dyslexia in schools may have something to do with the large part in our modern lives of taking in information from the television, with the gross extra-occular movements incompatible with information internalisation during reading.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In reasoning about it now, I realise that different languages have different syntactic patterns, that place different demands on cognitive economy.  I am reminded of a greatly respected elder, an elderly relative who fiercely defended her traditional methods of teaching languages through grammar translation to some extent, but particularly through repetition, repetition, repetition.  I was a TESOL teacher, defending the modern view of total immersion acquisition of language.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When one examines a syntactic tree of language that makes up a sentence, one can find that the meaning of that sentence can be expressed in terms of the cognitive economy constraints on the muscular ballistics of the extra-occular muscles if reading, and the mimicked tongue muscles if listening.  In the case of a second language English speaker, they haven’t practised the production of the language to the point at which they can achieve that ‘spare room’, systemic redundancy I suppose, as one does when practising music.  Thus they have no autonomy in terms of language production, and generally produce language idiomatically.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Different languages have different syntactically derived patterns of neuromuscular cognitive economy, so a student needs to achieve that contrast achievement as I did when I ‘relearnt’ to read.  This is traditionally achieved through repetition, repetition and more repetition, but I think that it makes sense to try the method that I used, as long as the learner understands the rationale, that one is training one’s extra-occular muscle movements to the extent that when the retina is skipping along the sentence construction, it is pausing in appropriate positions to achieve an understanding of the meaning.  In other words, different languages have different resting positions for the eyes, so different semantic patterns.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I suspect that in order to achieve the understanding of meaning, the retina must foveate correctly in the syntactic position appropriate for the language, sufficiently well to achieve a level of systemic redundancy such that introspection can occur, to allow autonomy of interpretation, a measure of which is necessary to be able to sufficiently state that one can understand.  Understanding thus implies choice of interpretation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, to remind you, the listener models the speaker, the tongue neurons firing, with the tongue suppressed.  This internalises the language that the speaker is using as belonging to the listener.  There is an added constraint on this process of empathy. Again I refer to the work of Dr Porges, whose work I am not entirely familiar with, except to say that he has related the vagus nerve as having some functional role in empathy, since it both underlies muscle movements of facial posture and the movements of the vocal folds.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When I was at University, I came to the realisation that the tongue movements that we make are completely meaningless in themselves, an obvious sequitur to reading of Wittgenstein’s work.  The meaning of the tongue movements is fixed by convention (whilst cognitive/muscular economy contributes to their serial position). What I realised though, is that the intonational patterns are more important than the wiggling of the tongue, at least in terms of ascribing some fixed meaning.  </p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent"><a id="Figure8contextinspeech"></a><span style="font-size:14.0px">Figure 8. Context is everything.  A meme floating around in Facebook.  I doubt that a ‘strong mind’ is demonstrated by being able to ‘read’ this.  However, it shows how context of words can constrain their meanings, where the syntax and the perception of the prototypical greater phrase are constraints.  In spoken language, I greatly suspect that intonational patterns figure highly as a constraint, and in written language also perhaps, since we tend to trace out the sound of the words we are reading using the neurons underlying speech production, and thus are subject to the constraints of intonation, in our sotto voce.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If one accepts that the vagus nerve is connected to the major organs as well as the vocal folds, then it seems possible potentially, that the tongue movements of language, which we have come to organise in a hierarchical fashion, due to the fractal amplification of power being implicated into the process of catharsis of that power, constrained by the neuromuscular ballistics and the cognitive economy routines underlying them, and that the act of communication is the act of communicating the subdivision of intonation, in order to communicate hormonal expression of organs, or emotion as it is referred to.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What this underlying shared experience of hormonal expression relates, is the relative distance from one situation, emotionally, to another.  A modal distance then, and one which we share, in general.  We can understand that the distance from one emotional situation to another is the same for both of us, from experience.   Keeping in mind, that in addition to this and the processes listed in the previous paragraph, there is a powerfully omnipresent deictic reference in every statement, we are most likely in communication, sharing a mental model, a commonly held view anyway, I think. The important part of understanding how language production occurs, is to keep in mind that we are in the process of predicting, based on past experience, what words come next.  Rather than a process of prediction, perhaps it is better to see it as a process of achieving resolution.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0">The orange is on the plate.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">My knowledge of linguistics is not good enough presently, to be able to determine whether the orange is the subject or the object of the sentence.  Perhaps it depends on the greater context, I really cannot recall.   I want to suggest, though, that the moment the speaker has finished stating the words ‘The orange’ a primed mental model is in place in the listener that is awaiting resolution.  Perhaps the process of neural sublimation is occurring, and our conscious experience of that process leads us to complete the sentence appropriately.  Language, though, seems serial, but look at the desk or scene in front of you.  There are many things, that you are seeing all at the same time.  In language, though, you can’t say it all at the same time, and so language is constrained into a serial act of attentional inspection.  Below that linguistic bottleneck, though, are the neural correlates of the visual percept of the orange on the plate, and so the ‘whole’ of the sentence exists, just not in language, which, due to time constraints, has this serial ‘compression’ of the image into constituent parts, that are generally chosen for their impact on some overarching point that is being made.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As a final discussion of the subject of language, I want to consider the evolution of language.  I want to suggest that there is a slow process of shaping of words, over time, where the force that shapes those words is largely a consequence of cognitive economy.  What begins as a description of some complex phenomenon, then becomes whittled down to a sentence, perhaps some idiom, and then eventually becomes a word.  Each word that has evolved this way, with ellipsis of the more complex but less necessary areas of the original conversation, continues to contain, in terms of genetic potentiation of tongue musculature patterns, relations that can reinforce the occurrence of some stimulated neural complex, that then constrains meaning.  It is like we might refer to the way in which a baby sucks the nipple when presented, some components of our behaviour are steered, although minimally, by genetic experience.  So, language evolves to simplify descriptions of phenomena to the point at which there is a sufficient amount of redundancy for some new insight to be described.  This new insight then allows evolution to occur.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Modern humans are no different in physical form to that they held tens of thousands of years ago, and consciousness is defined by that physical shape, in terms of the limits of its ability to extend to the confines and extents of the environment that it inhabits.  So, we are as intellectually capable as those ancient ancestors, because we have the same shape. The shape that has changed, though, is that shape that is the technological metaphor inherent within language.  Each time we discover a new technology, that technology offers us a new metaphor with which to abstract away properties of the environment that we inhabit generally.  We are then able, through this paradigm shift, to find ourselves in a place where we then develop slowly, and through the application of cognitive economy in its definition of our linguistic forms, a great enough amount of systemic redundancy to afford us the opportunity to have some new technological insight.  The series of technological insights that we have had through our evolution have affected the ‘shape’ of the environment that we inhabit, where that environment includes the many, multi-faceted environments that language can create.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When considering connectionism, one can think of the electric potential that is communicated as neurons fire, as language, where the people are the neurons.  This might allow us to arrive at a social psychological description of humans that is amenable, in terms of information theory, to analysis by connectionism.  The individual flows through this environment, just as language flows through the individuals.  I discuss this social psychological metaphor in more depth later in chapter 22.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Finally, understand that the brain is never really static.  There is no point at which neurons are not firing.  They are all firing, all of the time, or at least when blood flows past them.  It has to flow past them with sufficient power or they won’t fire, so the blood that innervates neurons can be thought of having a multi-dimensional threshold, the dimensions being speed, volume, cross-sectional area, amount of nutrients, amount of oxygen, and amount of waste product.  And, perhaps acceleration.  Because all areas of the brain are connected, at any given time your visual perception of the view in front of you is innervating language centres, and neurons that represent the muscles of the tongue and other speech effectors are firing, continuously, to describe that continuous experience of viewing a scene.  The brain makes sense of these speech effector movements, just as it does when dreaming, but the continuous chaotic chatter of half described satchels, and piles of books stays below the level of conscious awareness, at least normally.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">From this thoroughly dynamic background chatter, we promote the statements that we want to hear, I suspect.  Freewill, which I characterised as the battle between endogenous and exogenous cues, is continuously operating, and sentence structure in terms of articles and verbs are probably instances of systemic redundancy, so they appear almost automatically.  The subject and object is then a matter of endogenous selection from the background of exogenously competing objects.  The greater context acts as a constraint on selection.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 14:</span> <a id="a903DynamicSystemsTheory"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">Dynamic Systems Theory</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A dynamic system is one that is difficult to separate out from its background, at least in terms of its existence as a thing that is separate from the consequences of the background environment.  As the environment moves and changes, so does the human, neurally.  It is through inhibition of movement that the body does not covary with the environment that it is in.  So how can I say that the neural system is a dynamic system i.e. with no abstracted serial process, as some might suggest?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">To begin with a rather meaningless truism - 'there is no such thing as now'. This refers to the fact that the cognitive system is continuous - it doesn't have discrete symbols in it as the cognitive science movement and its computer metaphor might suggest.  So if I click my fingers, when does the event occur as far as the cognitive system is concerned?  Is it when the noise occurs, or at that moment that it is perceived by the auditory mechanism?  Or when the visual striate cortex assesses from experience that a movement has been made capable of generating sound?  Or when the totality of perception creates in the individual some sort of response?  If the cognitive system is continuous with the environment then perhaps it is at all those times.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The problem of positing the cognitive system as a continuous system is that there is little in the way of language that is appropriate outside of scientific formalisms that allow us to visualise how it might work.  If the cognitive system is continuous and we indeed flow through our environment does that mean that the present is simply a memory from time elapsed 0?  Does that mean that studies of memory might inform us about how the cognitive system is working in real time?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What you might consider to be a discrete symbol in language is not represented anywhere in the brain, rather there are patterns of muscular activity for the production of that symbol, the muscular patterns underlying the movement of the tongue, lips, jaws and the lungs (the speech production mechanism) etc.  The thought that you can perceive as language is the activation of the neurons that underlie the speech production mechanism although you have learnt to inhibit the movement of those muscles, and the phenomenon of thought is the audiological neurons being activated by the activation of those neurons underlying the speech production mechanism.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One can determine, therefore, that distal functional neuronal assemblies in the central nervous system are connected, as the area implicated in audition is not located in the same place as that for muscle movement.  We are dynamic systems that are connected continuously to the environment that we are in.  Have a look at the environment around you.  Are the things that you see on the outside of your head or on the inside?  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If you have studied the central nervous system for any amount of time, you may be able to answer that the external environment is represented on the inside by the firing of neurons that represent the colour, spatial location etc. of those objects that we perceive.  The intuitive human answer is that the objects are almost certainly on the outside.  The truth is that they are on the outside and the inside at the same time, when we close our eyes, the continuous flow of information is broken (again there is very little idiom available in language for this phenomenon - we simply haven't spent enough time discussing it as humans).  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-size:100%;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;text-transform:none;background-color:transparent">This break in information that occurs when we blink is interesting as it turns out that there is a period of blindness called 'intra-saccadic' blindness that occurs as we fixate the different areas of the environment.  This intra-saccadic blindness could explain why we are prone to symbolic representation, and it is our penchant for symbolic reasoning, as well as the coincidence of the commercially important computer, that is one of the foundations of the acceptance of the belief that we are not dynamic systems.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I suggest that in the dynamic neural system that flows through the environment, everything that is seen is stored as language.  Actually, its stored as everything, since every neuron has a functional role when something is represented, in that it's activation state contributes to the state that represents, to us, some recalled memory. So, as we experience the environment, all our neuronal assemblies are firing in a way that allows us to maximally interact with that environment.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The present is simply memory at time + 0, and hopefully, you will be able to see that what I am describing falls under the general rubric of dynamic systems theory.  A dynamic system is one that's parts move in concert with its progress through some environment.  Effectively, our cognitive system is flowing through an environment, swimming through it in a manner of speaking.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">We were once fish, and later slugs, although not necessarily in that order, and the idea of swimming through an environment, that moves through us, is perhaps more visible than the modern human, who, one might hope, isn't continuously eating, the food flowing through us as plankton once might have done.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As we flow through the external environment, we find ourselves experiencing continuously changing neural states, and those neural states represent the total firing of all neurons that are connected to any assembly that is stimulated by the arrival of the percept, the neural image from the perceptual sense.  The greater percentage of the brain, almost all the neocortex, is originally, and continues to be, dedicated to the fine motor control of the tongue, the greater percentage of neurons that are firing subserve some role in the creation of the linguistic description of the current scene.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A choir of a hundred thousand voices sings us into every new environment, into every 'scene' that is experienced.  Those voices are all our own, and they are not voices so much as the parts of potential linguistic descriptions of the percept that is arriving, continuously updated, to our neural system.  The energy that is dissipating preventing a continuous echolalia, as a continuous linguistic description of the experienced external environment, catharcises through the neocortex, 'gated' in its expression, flowing through the pathways that are more easily cajoled into firing, the percept being strained through a selective colander of sorts - we all have a brain like a sieve!</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">During that continuous flow through that environment, with the percept being dissolved into salient constituent features that represent a reinforcing of experience, as they find the path of least resistance, that total neural state at any given moment, sums to a situation where certain parts of the external environment will be more exogenously strong in terms of attracting attention.  At some point this can overcome endogenous control of attention, and those parts that are more attended to than others, becoming, as the total percept flows through the neural system, new salient features.  This way, at some points of our flow through an environment discriminable, individual states occur that are the totality of neural excitation in response to some environment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The neural system is environment agnostic.  It does not have a pre-determined shape or form.  It is, if you have been following me, the institution of various consistencies of fat, to the point at which new neurons are created, through the application of the waste product of neural firing from existing neurons.  To the neural system, any regularly repeated environment is of enormous use.  Why?  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Because, in this continuously changing dynamic system, fixed states that can be viewed regularly enough on a repeated basis, represent a high value to the brain in terms of its ability to efficiently recall some neural state or other.  There are different fixed environments, such as the physiological states that represent, as discriminable emotions, the firing of the neurons of the organs in a certain configuration; body states as I term them in chapter 8.  The external fixed environments, such as the arrangement of pictures on your wall at home, and the positions and shapes of things on your mantelpiece in the sitting room, are even more important, since they are repeated regularly, and with no effort on the part of the body/brain to conjure up, in the way that an emotional state can be continuously biased into moving.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This last observation is particularly important to appreciate in the case of geriatric psychology.  As the individual ages, their own bodily constraints on their knowledge and memories, are weakened, the drives eventually weakening to the point that there is no internal constraint on attention at all and dementia occurs.  It is a commonly understood consequence of moving a person to a nursing home, that often, dementia and death can follow quite rapidly.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The reason is because as the drive becomes weaker with age, our reliance on our external environment massively increases.  Even taking a set of pictures from the person’s regular environment, their living space, to the nursing home, and positioning them in precisely the same layout, with reference to one another, and perhaps to some canonical feature of the original room, like a window or door, should theoretically encourage the maintenance of healthy levels of attention in the ageing person.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In order to properly understand neural ‘life’, one has to appreciate the nature of the dynamic system.  To the brain, the arrangement of the features of the home environment are simply a represented state.  Internally, what is stimulated are the potentiated but inhibited movements of interaction with that environment.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Those potentiated neural complex origins, like all neural origins that are the potentiated but inhibited movements, remain active in the brain, until the point at which during sleep, the REM sleep discharges all of that potentiation through a process of resolving it by modelling during sleep, i.e. dreams.  That potentiation that is the potential interactions with our home environment is repeated daily, recharged as we navigate ourselves towards toast and coffee, in our bleary eyed, yawny early morning states.  It is such a regularly repeated feature, that we probably develop regularly permanent neural complexes or origins.  It is the loss of those environmental constraints on internal neural deixis, that mean that moving house scores so highly on the Holmes and Rahe live events scale.  Lose those tonal distances between the features of our environment, and the brain must work much harder. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There is a more powerful anchor to represented states, more powerful than the features of our home environment and their relative placement to one another.  It is, and I hope you guessed it, our loved ones.  They represent to us, a highly feature rich part of our external, regular environment.  We can endogenously locate them in different external environments, we can interact with and successfully predict the outcome of our interactions with them.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">They are fixed environments, that co-vary with our selves in predictable ways, and thus are highly salient features of our environment.  The potentiated, but inhibited interactions with them, which include regularly stated phrases, their name etc, and ways of physically interacting with them, i.e. by hugging or shaking their hands, all become important features of their totality of 'information' that they represent in terms of our exogenous response set and endogenous control of them as environments.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The facial expressions of our loved ones are the most highly important set of these parts of their presentation to our neural system as anchors of representational states, since it is always the distance between features that makes it useful as an anchor, as a sublimated neural complex, hence the manner in which metaphor populates all parts of our communicative experience, for example.  That distance between the features can be manipulated, with predictable results, by the brain, and these different expressions, I surmise, mean that they, as people, become important to the brain as anchors to the different discriminable representational states that we are in during the day.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is this reason, that when we lose something from our environment, particularly if it is suddenly lost without our endogenous control, i.e. stolen, our brain has to work really hard to stitch all of the representational states on to the new home, or other regularly repeated environment.  It works so hard, it often cries.  Then there is the loss of a loved one, through divorce or death, for instance.  Then, the brain has to work so hard, generally, that crying is almost inevitable; I include a discussion of crying later on in this book.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As we become older we are often more isolated from the importance of faces as sympathetic constraints on our internal attention, leaving our central nervous system neurons working harder, eventually developing plaques. Isolated from this important source of attentional aid, we start to talk to ourselves, repeating experiences in order to maintain their existence in the brain by repeatedly activating them.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">For the time that it takes to slowly resolve and depotentiate the old environment, there is crossover with the features of the new home environment, so stress, due to effort when coding to be remembered events and objects, as well as discriminable total neural states during the day is maximal, since the new anchors from the new home environment are not so readily available to be incorporated into the new representations that are the sublimated neural complexes.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Those discriminable total neural states, become the anchors to the other neural state information that is available to the body and CNS as the totality of information that is available from flowed through environment.  Then, when we want to rebuild our memory of the experienced environment, those total neural states are the prototypical anchors that are the prototypical exemplar of that environment, to which the rest of the information from that stream of information from movement, is attached.  When we want to recall some information we rebuild the environment that we were in when we experienced that information.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">At least a part of this environment is the set of language features that are primed by our movement through that environment.  Then when a clause is assembled, it contains a sufficient amount of the features from that environment to allow the recreation of that neural state.  So, language is successful in priming recall, when it can recreate, in a discriminable way, without interference and without noise, a sufficient amount of information to stimulate further neural complexes sufficient to rebuild the environment in which one coded the object or event.  A process of internal visual, audiological or haptic inspection of that environment, using the underlying neural complexes of the physical effectors of that perceptual information, then locates the desired information to recall, and not necessarily consciously.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="text-align:left;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I use the term normal psychology to contrast it with abnormal psychology, which as a specialist term in Psychology refers to illnesses that concern the mental health of the individual.  I, personally, would prefer to dub all things under the banner of normal psychology, since when one examines mental health and the patients that are in those situations, one finds that they are behaving quite normally, given their circumstances.  I think that if one were to find some behaviour that was exhibited in some unique idiopathic fashion by some individual, then that might be semantically classified as ‘abnormal psychology’ but in general there is not much behaviour that can be considered as uniquely idiopathic; if there were then the classification systems such as the DSM would fail those individuals.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="text-align:left;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Generally, when one considers the rubric of abnormal psychology, one finds oneself discussing some category of behaviour that deviates from the norm mainly by its inclusion in a classification system such as the DSM, but ignoring that distinction, when one examines the very nature of the fact that ‘mental health issues’ can be ‘classified’, one is admitting that people behave ‘normally’ when experiencing the circumstances that have put them into such and such a frame of mind.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="text-align:left;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I prefer this statement, that mental health service users are normal people, behaving normally in a difficult and different environment, because it might add to efforts to de-stigmatise the process of mental health issues.  One can classify that difficult and different environment in line with the theory of multiple environments (which I describe later, in chapter 21), which then renders the ‘illness’ as simply a transitory state, through which the individual is passing, which again, I prefer, as the long term patients of mental health issues have less wrong with them generally and more an incompatibility with the social environment.  I could quite easily defend the statement, for example, that the long term mental health patients are simply good people.   This is a reflection of the fact that it is necessary to lie, in our society, in a way that is best encapsulated by the term ‘diplomacy’. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="text-align:left;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px"> Often, mental health service users, have been traumatised at a young age, before puberty, in such a way that the ideals and logical purity of that age is preserved in their outlook in the manner that one finds with ‘memory bumps’, a term that describes the tendency for many adults to have a greater set of memories from their late adolescence and early twenties.  That is because more positive traumas occurred at that age, as well as an increased chance of negative traumas, and both of these act as biases when experiencing any environment in terms of the sentiments that are ‘woken up’ in memory.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="text-align:left;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Individuals who are often considered to be almost simpletons because they do not show any guile or social tact, can be considered as ‘abnormal’, despite the fact that literally speaking, they are just good people, their ‘goodness/innocence’ the sum of the preservation of traumatic episodes in their youth, as biases on the framing of later experience through a lens of an attentional style that could be described as ‘immature’ or innocent perhaps.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="text-align:left;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">So, what is meant by ‘normal’ psychology?  I am going to suggest that it is any process of functioning that wouldn’t allow a psychiatrist the opportunity to incarcerate you, but I might be a little biased in my definition.  Perhaps it is better to think of it as describing any psychological process that can occur in a way that allows the experiencer to continue functioning alongside others.  Most of the things that I might describe under the rubric of ‘normal’ psychology are things that we all experience.  These are things that I relate in a materialist framework, in this section, before examining what is generally called ‘abnormal psychology’ in the next section.   Perhaps the stigma is generated in part by that description, though, since it makes a categorical mistake.  It is not ‘abnormal psychology’, that is a logically unjustified ellipsis.  It is ‘the psychology underlying abnormal behaviour’, and more properly justified, ‘the circumstances and psychology underlying abnormal behaviour’.  With the term ‘abnormal psychology’ there is a tendency to imagine that the individual is abnormal, in a way that might lead to suggestions of structural differences or genetic differences between the individual with abnormal psychology and ‘normal people’.   However, this is simply not the case.  Normal people, placed in the circumstances that mental health service users have experienced, would behave in precisely the same manner as those mental health service users.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="text-align:left;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">So, a better description that abnormal psychology would be ‘normal people behaving normally, in difficult circumstances’.  Before I reach that section though, I will examine some of the features of ‘normal’ life that we all experience, from a materialist point of view.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">The person at sleep is a psychological state that is still poorly understood, or at least it was when I last studied, a little over 15 years ago.  I should probably do some reading before I write, I guess, that is the normal 'way of things' but I have been treated to some fairly unhealthy levels of conditioning using malevolently targeted ECT, and it doesn't encourage one to read.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Furthermore, I am really hoping that writing this 'book' will help me to get closure, as some thieves that stole from me my insights over the last ten years, have treated me to a testosterone reduction program that leaves me rather continuously attempting to recreate my final year at university.  Twenty years later, I quite fancy moving on to something else.  Anyway, in my 'rumination' about psychology I noticed the way in which REM sleep occurs, and that disturbed REM sleep leads to a gradually increasing level of background stress.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I received disturbed REM sleep in the mental hospital.  The mental hospital was a place where I met many people experiencing different types and levels of mental health issues, in a way that, as a patient myself, allowed me to gain the benefit of the insights and experience of those people without any inequity of relationship such as is implied by the client/practitioner relationship, so I had the opportunity to gain some insight.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There, in the mental hospital, REM sleep was interrupted because the nurses waved torches in our faces every hour, 'to check' on us.  REM sleep was interrupted and the stress mounted.  There happened to be a new building in the planning stages, so, I suggested that dimmer switches be fitted, so that light could be gradually ramped upwards, thus not traumatically interrupting sleep.  This occurred and a greater amount of restful sleep occurred, to the benefit of all involved, except some nefarious types, who arrived to make all of our lives more difficult, their ‘torch waving’ scam having been discovered.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">REM sleep, I suspect, is constructed of the de-stressing of all of those potentiated neural complexes that are primed by passing near objects and scenes that we can interact with in some way.  I pass by a door, my grasp of its handle is potentiated. The grasp of that handle remains potentiated, since it is a commonly used muscular shape, until I go to sleep at night.  Or, perhaps, passing someone I recognise in the street, would potentiate a whole set of linguistic neural assemblies which would be present, potentiated, in the brain, until sleep.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">REM sleep, with the eyes wobbling backwards and forwards, is the unwinding of those potentiated complexes.  As they unwind, their connections to other parts of the brain are activated: the auditory cortex, and the areas on the retinal circuits, the muscular neural complexes of the leg or arm muscles, the tongue neurons etc.  All of the associated connections are activated as the potentiated neurons unwind - the activity being interpreted in the light of long term goals and worries as dreams.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The neural systems underlying vision are tasked to give that visual feel to dreams, as when asleep those systems are available to motivate.  When awake the visual system is permanently engaged in the business of perception, and since it is so primary as an information source, information tends to travel from the vision to other areas.  When asleep, though, the visual system is not busy, and so is retasked, its connections being excited and activated by neural activity elsewhere in the brain.  The final percept though, which is the summation of all neural activity that is triggered as the potentiated neural complex unwinds, is the dream.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">People often feel  threatened by a reduction of human psychology to clinical terms referencing 'the machine' but this potentially political vanity serves no real helpful purpose.  As an example, consider a materialist description of something as intimate as crying. Materialist psychology, or at least my treatment of it, is keen to consider the idea of the ‘function’ of some set of physical phenomenon, which to imply the term ‘function’ is perhaps a misnomer, since it rather implicitly may imply deliberate design, whereas if one unelipts the term, one might find the phrase ‘evolutionary function’ (aided our survival as a species) or ‘social function’ (helps us in maintaining our social ‘health’).  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Crying obviously has a social function, and an individual function; it may be said to have an evolutionary function as well. Crying, seen from the eyes of a materialist psychologist has a bodily function, and that function is to externalise salt crystals from the blood which are stripped from the blood as it passes the blood brain barrier. Those salt crystals do not harm the critical veins of the brain that deliver metabolites to the brain. Salt crystal, in fact any crystalline molecule, scrapes the veins, leaving the fat that is resident in the blood with a key to which it might adhere.  Blood delivery to the brain is of great importance in cognition, with particular reference to sub-serving attentional mechanisms and anything that blocks blood from getting to the neurons for whom it is intended, is at least one step away from good cognitive health. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Our survival is an important shared feature of the functional roles of the physiology sub-serving our psychology so as we burst into tears, we still need to be able to concentrate to some degree on our immediate environment.  The stimulus that causes us to cry suddenly puts our cognitive system under great load and in order to maintain a good degree of healthy brain function, the body must suddenly deliver a rapid increase in metabolised blood to the brain.  This sudden increase in blood and the salt separation that is necessary in order to maintain blood that has no crystals with sharp edges that might damage the veins of the brain leaves us in tears, the salt stripped from the blood before it enters the brain.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">We label this state in a variety of ways. some of which are helpful and some of which are not, but the reality of the functioning of the brain has not been touched upon in our many centuries of self analysis.  Normally, of course, salt crystals in our blood are stripped from the blood by a slower process than crying, and that normal process involves exhaling those salt crystals in a mist of vapour from our nasal cavity. In understanding this you might suddenly gain insight into the common cold - the brain is not requiring a sudden increase in blood delivery, but the blood is so much more saline that the nasal cavity is bogged down in saline mist.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Understanding this, one can see that no matter what the ‘function’ of crying is, in all cases, the brain is working harder, and requires more blood to be delivered.  The steep and sudden incline of blood delivery requires that the adrenal glands deliver a greater amount of mineralocorticoids into the blood to increase the viscosity of the blood, so that that blood can be delivered to meet the increased demands of the brain. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">These mineralocorticoids are amongst the ‘salts’ that are expelled at the eyes, liquefied in water.  I think that it may be of interest to note that the blood intra-cranially, is most likely extremely saturated with fat, the fat being squeezed in from the surrounding fatty mass of the brain.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the act of coding a piece of information for later retrieval, the individual uses constraints that allow the recall of that information by attaching the information to some enduring part of the individual's environment. This enduring part of the individual’s environment can be the internal physiological environment, or some neural configuration within the CNS<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn5" id="bodyftn5">5</a></span>.  It can be external to the individual.  Objects in the person's home environment become important in the sense that if a person wishes to recall some information, at least some part of his recent experience will be attached to that information conceptually. The points of high information in that environment are the relations between the objects in the environment. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This feature of cognition leaves the person experiencing other people's faces as points of extremely high information if they are located in the person's home. This is because the family member's face co-varies with the emotions that the individual expresses in predictable ways. When you break a cup, you might get annoyed, when something is stolen from your home environment you might shout and even shed a tear, so that the salt and other mineral crystals can be extracted from the blood supply before it passes to the brain, where it would otherwise score the internal side of veins and arteries allowing the fat to adhere. When someone dies, the brain has to work so hard to re-stitch the internal constraints in order to recall information successfully, that one cannot help burst into tears in the majority of situations.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I experienced a repeated traumatic issue as a child, one that affected me psychologically in a variety of ways.  Throughout my childhood, in my teens, right through to adult hood, I would find myself bursting into tears from time to time, often to the slightest of stimuli.  Heart string tugging adverts would leave me in tears.  I knew enough about psychology to put this down to the experiences I had when younger, rather than think of it as a character trait present for some other reason.  Later on, I had EMDR, a process I will describe in chapter 25.  After this, I stopped experiencing the state where I was close to tears.  The reason, I suspect now, is that resources are available to the brain in a limited amount.  There is only so much blood that can be pumped to the brain at any given moment, and in a person with PTSD, there are more sub conscious traumatic cycles than can be supported by the available resources.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One consequence of this is a difficulty concentrating, something that demonstrated itself both at school and at home as a child.  Another is the ‘sensitivity’ which is actually a state where the brain is so diminished in the available resources, that as soon as any event presents itself in a way that requires the brain to work, the blood brain barrier starts to filter salt crystals out of the blood in order to stop them from entering into the intra cranial veins and capillaries where it might lead to blockage.  Cry baby is an school playground insult that I recall.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This issue of the blood brain barrier and it filtering out the salt (mineral) crystals before entering into the blood brain barrier, would leave me, if I were a clinician investigating the common cold, beginning to wonder about the health of the kidneys during a cold, with particular reference to examining the salinity of the blood before and after the renal glands.  I suspect that excess liquid in the cardiovascular system is catered for by the creation and release of saline crystals, but I am not certain, although the mechanism of homeostasis is where I might concentrate my attention during investigation regarding a common cold.  The massive increase in salinity then shows itself in the form of a runny nose and other symptoms of the cold.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">This is a short chapter.  I was going to include this as the continuation of the previous chapter, since it is dealing with crying, but I was dealing with such sombre material as dying and life events, that I wanted to separate it out.  So, very briefly indeed, this chapter examines the crying associated with laughter.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">We cry with laughter, occasionally, and often the substance of humour is that it is an interruption of our normal flow of attention, described by the interestingly different word paraprosdokian.  As we laugh, caught out with our blood pressure, intra-cranially, following some particular vector, we need to suddenly move the cardiovascular resources to some other area, and the laughter is a consequence of the action of the lungs, pumping extra oxygen into the blood supply for the sake of encouraging a healthy process of sudden adjustment of cardiovascular hydraulic vectors.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">That change of adjustment of cardiovascular hydraulic vectors can be so demanding, from time to time, that one suddenly needs a far greater level of cardiovascular resources, and the sudden increase leaves us crying, as salt is scraped from the blood as it passes that filter, the blood brain barrier.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Perhaps one could use the amount of crying, when laughing, as a measure of the paraprosdokian success of the humour.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">Having been born in 1971, homosexuality as </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">an</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"> issue has faced my generation in the form of gender preference and what it means for us in society.  It is a societal outcome that I am proud of that society has chosen to legislate for the support of the freedoms of the individual.  Whilst this is true, I am not homosexual, and don’t wish to take part in any form of cultural imperialism.  However, I have some potentially testable beliefs regarding a materialist psychological description of the phenomenon.  Having known many homosexuals, I am aware that they, in the mid 1980s, were entirely happy to discover that they could explain that the cause of their behaviour is beyond their control, in line with the genetic explanation that arrived at that time.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">I don’t </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">believe</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"> that there is any genetic determinism of our sexual identity.  However, I do think that there is a connectionist level of description that can demonstrate how the individual may feel, from an early age, that they are homosexual or transexual.  What does create the feeling of gender ‘misalignment’ is the child’s internalisation of their immediate family politic.  Where the mother is more powerful, an evolutionary prerogative occurs.  We have, in general, experienced that environment where mothers have the greatest political power in a family, when resources have been rare.  This process leaves the hunter returning with no food, and the mother’s ability to balance the household economy at that time, leaves them increasing in their domestic ‘political’ power over the male of the family.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">What happens then is that the growing male, internalises the communicative ‘body shapes’ of the female of the family as the food drive, which underlies primarily, all cognitive acts, identifies the mother as the primary source of power over household resources.  The same process occurs to some extent, I believe, when a Queen rules over society.  Over the course of the 19<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span> century, Queen Victoria presided over a society that increasingly offered greater social and political power to women.  Those upper classes that were close to the monarchic family, tended to develop a softer spoken, more female, tone of voice than their counterparts further away from that source of influence, and their behavioural stereotypy demonstrated more female mannerisms.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">In either case, more noticeable female behavioural stereotypy present in the domestic environment, creates in the developing male, more female behavioural stereotypy, and whilst growing in childhood, the male with that female behavioural stereotypy, becomes more likely to ‘identify’ as female, at least in a society that labels a man with female mannerisms as occupying some category separate to masculinity.  The social category that is currently provided for this situation tends towards homosexuality.  In traditional society, the homosexual, even if that person can partner with someone else, will not have children, and this leaves there being a continuous bias to filter out and reduce the presence of gender orthogonal behavioural stereotypy in society, at least if the behaviour has a genetic ‘cause’.  So, when food is short, less children are born due to an increasing incidence of the occurrence of homosexuality.   So, the behaviour is both natural and of importance to survival.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">Whether or not that is true, though, homosexual individuals can marry, and be parents through a process of surrogacy or adoption.  The openness with which society has been able to perceive the label ‘gay’ has afforded those members of that category, increasing political power, through actually being represented.  So, the female stereotypy that is present in the mannerisms of the famous ‘queens’ of the 60s and 70s, such as Kenneth Williams, Melvyn Hayes or John Inman, presented the subject visibly, and inspired many homosexual men to follow suit, I would imagine, and like all else in this book, without research.  That exaggerated female behavioural stereotypy, gave homosexuals a public presence, sufficient to begin the negotiation of political rights for that group of people.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">In modernity, I guess that this process of public recognition will be reinforced with the emergence of the LGBTQI categories, such that eventually all of those different categorical ‘forms’ of sexuality will be acknowledged and they will have a useful political presence that results from that open acknowledgement.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"> However, with the Christian right rising, there is the risk that the suggestion that the behaviour of homosexual is genetically defined will be accepted by the radicalised Christians, resulting in eugenic justifications amongst those who are rather psychotically taken with that Christian meme, which is perhaps the most powerful of memes that the world has unfortunately faced in its existence.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">What I think one might be able to state, with reference to connectionism, in particular the emergent food drive and its growth as a principle bias, is that through a process of identification with female behavioural stereotypy, the male child (or the female where male behavioural stereotypy is increased against the background of the norm), will internalise that set of identity relations to the point at which that identity can become fixed and unchangeable, to one degree or another.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">To relate my comprehension of homosexuality from the point of view of a materialist psychologist, or at least this one, anyway, I suspect that the gender appropriate behavioural stereotypy forms part of a catalogue of behaviours that are related to our hormonal expression, and that hormonal expression is particularly related to form, with heterosexual male hormonal identity being testosterone fuelled to the point that that parallel linear movement that is promoted in the cardiovascular system by testosterone, becomes a stabbing motion in behaviour, where oestrogen becomes associated with absorbing, or encapsulating.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">This nurturist statement is what I propose, one that has the capacity to describe that experience by so many homosexual people, that they have felt that way since early childhood.  From early childhood onwards, for those individuals, the overall ‘shape’ that their neural system adapts into is one that has a gender preference that is defined, like everyone else, by their circumstance.  In the situation of a strong female politic, or the continuous presence of a stronger female hormonal presentation, the male child’s neural system aspires to be in a female shape, an evolutionary prerogative that sees the infant adopt the mannerisms of the powerful member of the family, in relation to food, as the food drive is centred with the developing cognition growing around it.  Similarity of form takes second place to similarity hormonally, and the adoption of mannerisms and inflections influence hormonal presentation.    </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">In the situation of a strong male politic, or the continuous presence of a stronger male hormonal presentation, and as a generalisation, the female child’s neural system adapts into a male shape.  As adults, though, there is no reason why they should adhere to any prescribed category.  Ultimately, love is love, and no matter what shape the couple, their love should defeat all obstacles.  Better to live in a society that supports choice than in one that belittles it.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">The danger, of course, is that in accepting some environmentally defined cause, and escaping Christian hate finding its expression in the form of eugenics, is that it will then, instead, target the parents with its violent tendency towards sadistic bullying.  It simply doesn’t like homosexuals, a fact I tend to ascribe to the initial conditions of its occurrence.  This was in a place where luxury in society had given rise to openly expressed homosexuality, that had been encouraged into existence due to the emergent matriarchy of Rome, itself a consequence of the diminished amount of men, who were required to serve in distant parts of the empire.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">I suspect that the fall of classical Rome, was to some degree, blamed on homosexuality, and this initial condition of the later developing culture of Christendom, has seen the continuous presence of homophobia as the norm.  There seems to be little chance of escape from some form of confrontation at some point with those people who would dictate our gender identity as ‘law’ at least currently, with homophobia on the rise in many places of what seemed like a civilised world.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">Making it more difficult to move away from some statement of choice is the LGBTQI ‘definition’, which, although being seemingly innocuous, is through categorisation, moving personality away from choice even further.  It can be viewed as a necessary stage in the development of a sufficiently well known and accepted political presence of that emergent minority, to have the labels.  One can see the different states of being that are available, and, through union, those represented individuals gain the freedoms of being awarded human rights.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">However, the categorisation of gender preference very subtly implies that choice is defined by some other.   No longer can one simply meet someone and form a relationship with that choice to do so defined by yourself and the other.  Now you have a ‘fixed’ gender preference, that you have acquired in a way that is beyond your choice.  No matter how efficiently a personality theory or in this case a description, defines its categories, categorical definition is always to the limitation of the individual. Overall, it doesn’t fit within a societal model of ‘redemption’, in the sense that when one is of one category, one may find it difficult to move to another.  Can one imagine a man, leaving his male partner, and later starting up an intimate relationship with a woman?  I would hope to live in a society where it was considered to be a perfectly normal thing.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">I think it is far more difficult when there is such overall agreement in the categories, and what they suggest, ‘genetically’.  Furthermore, those people who find themselves at greatest ease when categorising things are drawn to the LGBTQI definition, which I feel may potentially be a precursor to some pogrom or other, since it is that categorising mindset which is generally used to create the backbone of such movements.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">Choice is what it should be.  If one meets someone that one wants to have a lasting personal relationship with, one should overcome, or have the facility through a supportive environment to overcome, the biases against that personal relationship. If one wants to have a gender similar relationship, then one should be able to.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">However, as long as we continue to accept the idea that there is a homosexual gene, we continue to accept the idea that our behaviour can be defined before we are born.  And of primary importance to state is that the surest route to being able to instantiate slavery of the mind, in society, is through instantiating slavery over the body.  There is no greater form of slavery than being born into a fixed and unchanging role.  Thus gender identity can support the maintenance of notions of slavery in society, and so it is a particularly good thing that we are overcoming any historically informed opinions that limit our choices.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">The wisest thing that I have heard said about gender identity and gender preference, is that there is a distinct gender for every person that you can meet.  This makes sense from the point of view of a neural network, which can effectively ‘grow’/adapt into any situation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">I conceive of materialist psychology as I present it as a theoretic that falls largely on the nurture side of the nature/nurture divide.  There is virtually no genetic component to our self, although present in some biases it does not determine our behaviour in any way; memetics, the cultural transmission of information, is far more powerful in influencing our behaviour, and the two function together to achieve those set of biases that are amongst the foundations of the ‘self’.  In either case, though, the brain is an adaptive mechanism, and is capable of adapting to any shape that it finds itself in such as the ‘shape’ that genetics provides in the form of the shape of the body.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;text-transform:none;background-color:transparent">This last fact is essential.  With it in mind, I can propose a modified form of </span><span style="font-size:18.666668px">T</span><span style="font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;text-transform:none;background-color:transparent">abula Rasa, one that states that whilst we might be born with physically different </span><span style="font-size:18.666668px">'shapes’, our neural system adapting in to them leaves us with the potential for that blank slate idealism, the perfect state of equality.  A neural system can adapt into any shape.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">Any overarching ‘grand narrative’ that potentially may influence our commercial or political decisions finds itself in the firing line of attacks by merchants and malevolence.  Contemporary science has been befuddled to accept genetics in a number of different ways, for a number of different reasons.  Genetics and genetic determinism that follows, is a statement of ‘destiny’ that encourages the acceptance of the status quo, diminishing attempts at nurturing social mobility, and so its acceptance has been pursued in a number of almost unthinkable ways, by some rather malevolent agency.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;text-transform:none;background-color:transparent">As a brief foray into one example, the reporting of children that were tortured in 'genetic' experiments during the second world war left an already traumatised post war society traumatised in a particular way – in other words pathologically unable to stop thinking about genetics.  As this traumatically reinforced rumination became a subconscious bias, the people were sold denims that they wore tightly over their reproductive assemblies that were re-named 'Jeans' evoking the muscular ballistic neural co</span><span style="font-size:18.666668px">mplex homonymy of the word 'genes’</span><span style="font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;text-transform:none;background-color:transparent">.  Genetics, as a science, is then reinforced with a number of other sources of perceived ‘authority’ including naive ‘studies’ of homosexuality and twin studies.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">In either case, a discussion of these issues that deviates away from the accepted norm inflates tensions amongst those commentators who have settled for that accepted norm.  In the case of twin studies, the results seem unquestionable to some, until one appreciates how it is that the human, from neonate through to old age, learns.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">As one studies connectionism, it becomes obvious that the human central nervous system is learning by miming the actions of others most generally, or modelling it in a more abstract sense.  It attaches the copied behaviours, or some reasonable facsimile of them to the ‘anchor’ of their complex environmental physiology, the sum of those things that they carry around with them, such as their hormonal expression and the cognitive expression of those environments that they find themselves in regularly. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">One can then appreciate that in the case of the identical twins, there exists less ‘noise’ in the act of facsimile of behaviour; with non identical twins there exists a greater level of noise, yet there may be functionally similar identities at the anatomical level of description that give them an advantage over unrelated couples with regards to performing well in those experimental situations.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">Homosexuality is accepted as clearly related to genetics in the late 1980s, off the back of news stories that occur at roughly the same time as the legalisation of homosexuality in the late 1960s, in which children are taken from parents by social workers following theory that is seemingly nurturist in content, the parents being ‘blamed’ for their homosexual children.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">The wave of support for the genetic theory then grew to the point of acceptance such that many homosexuals reported a sense of relief at accepting the idea that their fate is beyond their control, as it provided them with the opportunity at the time to justify the prevention of homophobic acts of violence that were occurring still then.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">Those acts of violence were certainly uncalled for, as was the homophobia that supported them, but to support the theoretical acceptance of the genesis of some psychological phenomenon purely on the basis of its consequences is to render one clearly into the territory of teleological reasoning, or ‘argument from purpose’, which, despite its potential utility in this situation, does nothing to enrich our scientific comprehension of the world around us.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">At the same time, and by the same token, it is worth appreciating that science, no matter what its deliberation states about the nature of reality is not a vehicle for socio political justification.  The logistics of living together bear some importance to that justification, whether it is law or political acceptance, but ultimately it is all a matter of convention; of agreement.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">  So, if society is in favour, one can choose one’s sexual orientation.  I am going to go out on a limb and suggest that if one is a man then that choice becomes more likely to be fixed, with any repeated encounter of pleasurable anal sex. The reason is that the testosterone levels in the man depend upon the power with which the chyme is driven through to the adrenals, where it is filtered into testosterone, oestrogen and other androgens, and that the positive trauma of penetration of the anal sphincter through a physical consequence can weaken the power with which the muscular contractions of the colon operate.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">It follows that after some period of time being on the receiving end of sodomy, that the man will be more likely to adopt female mannerisms, due to the diminished amount of testosterone that reaches the cardiovascular system.    If I am correct, and it is understood, then one can potentially envisage a situation where one can train oneself with or without some help, if one wants to become more heterosexual.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">Admitting this possibility means to acknowledge the responsibility that comes with the potential possibility that extremists might try and ‘retrain’ or similar, homosexual men.  It is to the great shame of humanity, that the twentieth century contained many examples of the painful ‘training’ of individuals, a behaviour that was certainly bourne out of psychotic sickness in the minds of the ‘trainers’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">However, I am currently of the opinion that the majority of the decades of the 20<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span> century, when homosexuals were being regularly exposed to ECT and other torturous forms of ‘psychiatric’ cure, that the suggestion that the responsibility for this treatment lay with Christian extremists, is exaggerated.  As I will suggest in appendix C, the use of a targeted form of ECT has been developed that can, with the aid of computational power, and headphones, train the brain to the point of virtual possession, with everything from induced denial and avoidance behaviour to entire dialogues sotto voce and complete alter egos being developed.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">The development of these techniques, blamed on Christians, was actually conducted by criminals, who used the mental hospitals as they would have done with dungeons in previous centuries and who have been using that technology that they developed to influence politics and national and international economics.  It includes as a technique, the ability to make the victim forget the treatment.  I will detail the technique later in appendix C.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">In sum, for those of you who managed to read this far, and who might be fuming at my suggestion that there is no genetic component to homosexuality, may I reiterate, whilst there is no genetic component, the choice can certainly be ‘fixed’ and beyond the choice of the individual.  The neural system, whilst capable of adapting, reaches points at which it can not unadapt from the behaviour that it has taken on.  And ultimately, modern society has accepted that it is within the scope of our basic human rights that we can be intimate with whomsoever we choose, no matter what shape they are, as long as they are of age and give their permission.  In accepting this, we have taken a great step away from slavery and towards freedom.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">You might not be inclined to want to draw the category of racism under the rubric of ‘normal’ psychology, but then I ask you to identify with those who might not want the category of homosexuality under the same rubric either.  What I am describing, in both cases, is normal behaviour.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is actually far easier to define racism in materialist terms than it is homosexuality, but when one does, one can identify and empathise with the people who are practising that behaviour, whilst still continuing to ardently disagree with their opinions.  <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">O</span>ne might hope that, armed with a reasonable psychological description of what is occurring, those individual racists might actually be able to label their feelings in a more acceptable manner than they currently do.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Currently, there are strong centres of racism, in places in Britain that have high exposure to immigrant populations from culturally different places.   Those people who are demonstrating the racist behaviour are in a situation where they are experiencing cognitive stress that is then forcing them to catharsise that stress, and they are doing so in ways that are defined as acceptable by their peer group.  What one can see, as one inspects the towns and cities that are affected by this experience, is the impact of a theoretical device in the brain, that is called the ‘stereotyping mechanism’.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This mechanism, which is part of the cognitive assembly of every individual, allows us to categorise swiftly, groups of related informational points in our immediate perceived environment, into a single percept.  With it, we see a set of bricks as a wall, for instance.  When it comes to the towns and cities that have immigrants in them, we see the stereotyping mechanism responsible for the creation of ‘quarters’, areas of that civic location becoming completely ‘black’ or completely ‘Indian’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Many of the problem individuals, who act aggressively against immigrants are people who traditionally, trace their family line back to fighting families, I suspect, but even where this doesn’t exist, the economic impact of living in an employment impoverished environment, leaves those original inhabitants of that area, concerned about resource allocation.  Once again, it is the food drive at the centre of cognition that encourages this.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When faced with a group of individuals of some different culture, most people who have no experience of that different culture feel, to some extent, awkward.  This is the consequence of the stress that occurs as the stereotyping mechanism tries, unsuccessfully, to find individual markers, to make out individual instances.  With no cultural experience of those individuals or their backgrounds, the individual perceives the group, rather than the individuals, and this leaves them in a situation where they are more likely to perceive the group as ‘larger’ than themselves, in their subconscious, to the extent that they then perceive it, at least subconsciously, as a threat.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When faced with individual exemplars, other factors serve to cause the difficult feelings that are then labelled with racist terms.  The accent of those speaking their own language, Hindi perhaps, or Urdu, present a set of intonational patterns that are oblique and orthogonal to those intonational patterns utilised by the individual who originates from that area in Britain where racism might exist.  This means that that individual might see some people who are playing pool, for example, and their playful behaviour is accompanied by intonational patterns in their speech which are at odds with the same behavioural acts in the language of the observer.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The experience of this obverse behaviour is at odds with cognitive mechanisms which are primarily involved with predicting the behaviour of others.  One can objectively operationalise the term ‘trust’ as being an act of prediction of behaviour, and so the observer experiences lack of ability to predict, based on the obverse intonational patterns, and the feeling is one of lack of trust, which further exacerbates the experience of stress.  This experience of cognitive stress is then labelled as racist sentiment by the racist, who, without any comprehension of the stereotyping mechanism finds themselves experiencing stress that they need to catharsise when presented with individuals from an unknown culture.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This is made more difficult in Britain since many of the racist individuals traditionally originate from Britain, which has been, as a rule, due to its geo-meteorological situation, mostly possessed culturally by greens and browns in its colour choice, where as those who arrive from the Indian sub-continent have brightly coloured clothes that are a consequence of the many brightly coloured flowers that are present in their environment (a consequence of migrating birds?).  So, the pressures domestically, in terms of their fears of lack of work and lack of resources, which are valid political statements are then drowned out by the racist terminology that they employ and this leaves them politically destabilised and living with more stress.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What they need to do, is to be able to make out individual exemplars in that immigrant group, and this will only come through getting to know one another.  It should be part of any civic strategy to prevent the stereotyping mechanism from creating quarters, areas of homogenous origin or colour, since as those places emerge, the stereotyping mechanism is reinforced in its power, as there is an evolutionary prerogative that operates.  The individual who cannot make out individual exemplars of an attacking group, is better able to cut them down in battle, encouraging the survival of that group, and I think that the cognitive isomorphy of this evolutionary bias, biases the families of the former soldiers that patrolled the British Raj, who are more inclined to racist attitudes as a result.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, once again, they are normal people, behaving normally, in a different environment.  Through understanding the environments faced by those individuals, one can encourage through education, an appreciation of cognition that allows those individual to label their feelings in line with a neutral description of human behaviour as presented by materialist psychology, rather than give in to the politically disempowering statements of racism.  I think then, that you will hear their complaints as rational statements concerned with fear for their children’s ability to successfully seek work or obtain accommodation, in that area where an increase in population is visible marked.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">The process of pain is the process of neurons firing so much that they become overloaded with their own waste product.  The process of those neurons finding themselves unable to meet the needs of their continued firing, leads to the feeling of pain, that as a process has a function, which is that of biasing the cardiovascular hydraulics, to the extent that the delivery of blood to the affected area increases.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Acupuncture, I suspect, has any mechanism of action explained by its capacity to create a bias to the cardiovascular hydraulics and the delivery of blood to affected areas.  So, one can potentially examine the body of work that is the competent studies of acupuncture and find some useful information that might inform one as to the process or presentation of the cardiovascular hydraulic ‘map’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One can achieve a similar effect to acupuncture, if it is the case that the pins of acupuncture are biasing the cardiovascular map, using ‘deep heat’ or some other menthol rub, or tiger balm for example.   No matter how the cardiovascular hydraulic map is biased, once it is, one can increase the amount of nutrients that are to be delivered to that area either in one’s diet, or as part of a therapeutic intervention. This might mean taking some preparation orally, and then engaging in acupuncture, but one can potentially conceive of modern technology allowing relatively complex biasing of the cardiovascular hydraulics to the extent that some introduced elixir for health might arrive at some resulting location with ease.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Perhaps one might re-employ FMRI, if a better resolution is obtained, to the extent that one can gradually shape the adrenals into a situation where they respond to some stimulus by presenting cardiovascular pressure in some particular position in the brain, so that one can then target some growth or blockage.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">To continue the eastern theme, I would suggest that yoga can be considered to be in that general group of behaviours that functions in part, because it biases the delivery of the blood to a particular area.  As one concentrates on the different poses that make up the exercise, one is exerting a practised deliberate control over individual muscle groups, and I suspect that this empowers the individual to have a healthier cardiovascular response to those areas.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the same way, in a manner of speaking, I would suggest that one of the brain’s principal roles is to predict how to adjust the internal cardiovascular hydraulics so that the resources are available when and where they are needed.  One can think of the neural system in this regard as dealing with the body as a ‘bubble of blood’.  To encourage health in this regard, badminton is a great exercise, and should be associated, I suspect, with improving models of mental health.  The sport is replete with sudden, unanticipated moves, that require the brain, whilst concentrating, to devote cardiovascular resources into a different location.  Practising this is undoubtedly beneficial for the brain when it comes to the business of social interaction including conversation, both tasks requiring the successful prediction of where to devote cardiovascular resources, very suddenly, and entirely unpredictably in the case of an interesting or humorous conversation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I am not a fan of meditation.  I see it as an unworkable thing for anyone with even the slightest degree of mental health issues.  For those people lucky enough to not suffer from mental health issues, meditation might be a useful ‘quiet’ time, but in most mental health issues, there is a pathological component that prevents one from meditating.  When failing meditation as a mental health patient, one is further moved into the category of mentally unwell, and is medicalised further.  I see the wide held subscription to eastern meditation as a cause of increase of medication sales.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">However, there is something that I dub ‘western meditation’ that is of great use, which is where an individual has to concentrate on some task so heavily that they cannot think.  Generally, if they start thinking, then they fail at the task.  Examples include music making, or knitting, and one particularly useful task in this bracket is needlework.  When one stops paying attention at needlework, one stabs oneself in the finger.  This is the reason why western meditation has incorporated samplers, the women traumatised by their PTSD experiencing husbands returning from war, and engaging in successful meditation.  A perceived suspension of sotto voce, through needlework.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 21:</span> <a id="a907Thetheoryofmultipleenvironmentsandintelligence"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">The theory of multiple environments and intelligence</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Something that I call the theory of multiple environments is a useful heuristic definition that I will most likely refer to later on.  The theory of multiple environments suggests that all things can be classified as environments and that this classification is helpful for psychology.  If one considers the psychology of the individual, one can see that their psychology is made up of many different interacting environments; there is the external environment and the internal physiological environment but there is also the environment of fashion, the environment of mathematics, the environment of language, the environment of hair cuts, the environment of food and so on and so forth.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Referring to this rather expansive taxonomy to classify the state of the individual according to the environments that they are currently dealing with is a relatively homeomorphic (one to one) representation of what the central nervous system is actually doing as the brain can be demonstrated to be representing differing environments in similar ways.   The sum of all environments that are currently being experienced is what the brain is actually processing; the term that I find useful when relating to others how they are thinking is the phrase cognitive landscape. This term can be applied to all of the environments including all of the cultural iconography, past experiences and physiological influences that have a bearing on cognition.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The theory of multiple environments is a powerful definition, perhaps too powerful in the logical sense, but each environment covers the totality of cognitive structures that are brought to bear on that environment.  So the 'environment' that faces the individual at any given time, is made of the summation of the task demands of all of the other environments that the individual is currently experiencing, so the physical environment, the internal physical environment, the social environment, the environment of fashion, the environment of language etc etc. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">An application of the theory of multiple environments that illustrates how it is useful as an idea is to analyse intelligence.  Currently, theories of intelligence revolve around the idea that intelligence, as a construct, works around different types of intelligence.  Gardner's theory of intelligence, for instance, suggests that there are 7 different types of intelligence: linguistic intelligence, emotional intelligence, spatial intelligence etc.  I consider that these different approaches to describing intelligence are fairly superficial and bear no real resemblance to what is happening at a psychological level, let alone a neuropsychological level, except perhaps the theory of emotional intelligence, but that is debatable.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Intelligence when viewed through the lens of the theory of multiple environments becomes a statement of equality - aside from the attentional differences that one might experience due to inhabiting a different social environment when developing, everyone is intelligent in their own field.  So a hairdresser is more 'intelligent' in the environment of hair cuts than a professor of archaeology.  Furthermore, one can derive a definition of general intelligence - the faster one can adapt into any novel environment, the more intelligent one is - although even this has limits to the extent that it might be more intelligent to adapt into a particular environment slowly and carefully, so the final definition of general intelligence becomes 'the ability to adapt healthily into any novel environment as rapidly as possible'.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Whilst this statement is a real world definition with real world applications and holds true in reducing all other definitions, the real achievement of the theory of multiple environments is to be able to realistically explain intelligence without reference to some stratified pecking order or other in terms of its consequences.  As it realises this achievement, it does so in a way that is specified in terms that are grounded in the reality of the underlying functioning, in that at any moment the sum total of the neural processing of the individual is expressed most succinctly as the totality of many different neural complexes, all tuned to different specialisations.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The defining feature of the ability to display intelligence in any area, is the amount of interest one has, and this is modified by issues like attentional deficits stemming from conditions like depression.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I mention also that the environment that one develops in matters.  Well this is because when one takes a relevant and useful description of socio-economic environment, one can see that the socio-economic environment that one develops in is a an immersive environment that is differentiated from others by attentional affordances, i.e. by the type of cognitive landscape that one requires to successfully inhabit that environment.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If one grows up in a working class environment, then one is more likely to be presented, on a daily basis, with logical relations arising from linguistic forms that have a much shorter and more repeated attentional ‘shape’.  This is because that attentional ‘shape’ is of far greater utility in developing healthily into an environment of manual labour, where the trades are generalised specialisations in comparison to the professions, that are really rather greedy, hogging the work.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">At some point in history, somewhere in the early mediaeval economy, professions, I suspect, became stripped down into their component parts, so that many people would do the work of one professional.  This allowed a more fluid work force to occur, one that could adapt to the changing demands of the built environment far more quickly, as the employed were now masters of one trade rather than jack of all.  Currently, we are faced with a similar dilemma.  It is that the professions, which have been inhabited by the descending aristocracy over the course of the last century,  have too much ‘power’ in the sense of power capable of producing work, and have become a bottle neck that leaves them capable of demanding far greater wages.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Those professions should be stripped down into their component parts, and those component parts should be taken up as trades.  The result would be a far greater amount of equity, far less unjustifiable hierarchy in society, etc.  This socio-political digression of mine, may be an act of apologism, since I do not want to be considered as suggesting in anyway that the socio-economic bracket that is inhabited by the working classes, is some how ‘less’ than the professional ‘caste’ in terms of its working requirements for attentional demands.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The professions, who have a far more regulated environment in terms of allowable types of language, are more familiar in their environment with polysyllabic terms that are capable of expressing complex situations in the space of one word, where that other socio-economic bracket, inhabited by the tradesmen and labourers, can express the same concept but using more words, and sometimes vice versa.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Actually, when one is familiar with some trade or specialisation, one realises that all trades and professions have these complex terms but that professions are presented as having more of them in the cultural media, over which they have power, in a manner of speaking, since they fund the image that is created, which then tends to beautify them as a consequence.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Those from the professional socio-economic bracket, tend to employ a greater amount of polysyllabic terms that demand a different type of attentional style to those who are more ‘hands on’.  If one is from a working class socio-economic bracket, and wants to succeed in science, I greatly suspect that one would need to learn the language of that other socio-economic bracket, like one might learn a foreign language.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, the description of intelligence that is provided by the theory of multiple environments supersedes, I think, earlier definitions.  This couldn’t come sooner for some. The traditional definitions of intelligence are conventions that are generally socio-politically administered in terms of the limits of their capacity to define the subject.   The consequences of these biased and rather arbitrary definitions, from which attempts are made to shoehorn empirical evidence into ‘theoretical’ models that support them, have often been negative and at best merely justify the status quo of accepted social order.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A good example stems from the way in which these stratified, class centric definitions are ‘tested for’ in end of school examinations. These exams, that often define our self expectations for the rest of our lives, result in the children of the wealthy faring better than those who do not come from a privileged background.  Without understanding the fact that stress affects memory along with the fact that spare money has a tendency to diminish our stress, particularly in a consumerist society, our understanding of human psychology is falsely skewed, and models that might support some less changeable feature of reality may find currency; for political reasons and the justification of lowered cost, models that are more nature than nurture are often accepted.   The reality is often of secondary importance when cost, or maintaining one’s entrenched position in a hierarchically arranged political situation is concerned and that is ‘bad’ science.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">So, what can a materialist analysis of psychology state about group psychology?  A materialist analysis is focused on the material, i.e. the physical body of the individual, so how might the less grounded, less physical, almost metaphysical status of group psychological phenomenon be located in the material existence of the physiology supporting human consciousness?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	The first observation that I made related to the existence of a 30 year ‘cycle’ of fashion, where fashions for cultural media were repeated every 30 years, in what seemed like more than just the next generation picking up the accoutrements of the previous.  In any case, the repetition was related to its origin in a metaphorical sense, rather than in any concrete fashion.  It was as if the cultural media was being repeated and reinterpreted, with a fixed amount of time, between the two repetitions that reflected, perhaps, some sensitive period in development, being cognitively influential as that generation of individuals came into power in terms of the availability of disposable income.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	It is a little complex to detail here, with each decade containing several or more strands of cultural media that were sufficiently discriminable from one another as forms, to be noticeable as an influence thirty years later.  I will probably attempt to diagram it later.  I’m not a fan of the suggestion that there is a sensitive or critical period in development, as I see the neural system as plastic, and malleable for the entire duration of one’s life.  However, one has to be able to discern some influence in order to be able to control how it influences one’s behaviour.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	My second observation that may potentially be described relates to the way in which we comprehend language, as well as how we comprehend the behaviour of others; its influence on our own behaviour.  When we listen to some other person talking, we are using our language production centres in the brain, to model the movement of their speech effectors.  The tongue, and other speech effectors, such as the diaphragm, lungs and intonation of the vocal folds, they are all behaviours, the same as the movement of one’s arms and hips as one swings a golf club, for instance.  We observe the person swinging the golf club, when we first play, and model their behaviour when we produce our behaviour at the appropriate moment.  When discussing golf, or watching it, we are still modelling the behaviour of the limbs of the other, just without moving our own limbs.  In cases of cognitive stress and/or other mental health issues, the individual might not be able to inhibit the actions of the other.  In </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">psychology,</span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px"> this phenomenon is known as echolalia, and is sometimes observed in autistic people as well as others.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	When listening to language we are modelling the speech effectors of the other, it can be stated, at an abstract level, that we are connected with one another.  This abstracted level can produce an observation that suggests that human beings can be described, in groups, using the same tools as one might use to study or model neural information representation.  Connectionism is the term for the field of study, and if one examines its metaphor for neural activity, one can see that a series of neurons might be connected with some target neuron, and the additive effect of the firing of those primary neurons might influence the secondary target neuron, depending on the state of that target neuron.  If the additive effects meet some firing level of the target neuron, then the target neuron will fire, its activity stimulating other neurons later in the wave of activity.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	Now consider that description, but applied to humans.  Instead of neurons, the human being is the target ‘neuron’, and if the inputs aggregate to some firing level, then that ‘target’ human will start repeating that input to others.  Whilst I cannot, as per usual, provide any definite examples of research that does this, I am relatively certain that the metaphor holds.  If that is the case, then one might be able to model phenomenal observations from the field of advertising, and be able to account for the macro effects of any particular influence.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	With regards to the internalisation of language during comprehension, I examine the bigger picture, expanding it from simply the human chatter at any given moment, and consider the communications that one has experienced in one’s past, and their influence as biases on that person’s opinion.  This reveals that rather interesting possibility that perhaps one can consider the bias that is the bias upon the individual who is biasing the target individual.  How far might this extend?  To one’s grandparents?  To distant ancestors?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	I favour the latter, at least when seeing that network of cognitive bias resulting from the aggregative impact of repeated generations, as well as the deeply complex ‘zeitgeist’ of the present.  I personally think, that it is possible, at a superordinate level of description, to make an observation of thermodynamic effects that are truly group phenomena, since they find their location in the additive effect of sub-conscious biases, but are observable in the greater group.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	I refer to that network of effect, of aggregative effects of language internalisation during comprehension, as the ‘carpet of tongues’.  It is a dramatic term, perhaps, but I can visualise a complex woven 3 dimensional carpet, with relief illustrations, that can represent it.  Anyway, it is more catchy and discriminable than ‘linguistic internalisation network effect’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	What I see, when analysing this ‘carpet of tongues’, is that it is possible to state that influences on language and cultural development many thousands of years ago, can be described as having an influence on the humans currently.  It isn’t that there exists some lasting bias from some individual a long time ago, but the influence of that individual, a long time ago, on language, was important in determining the ‘shape’ of our culture and language now. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	How might some individual have influenced so powerfully as to become a determinant?  I suspect that monarchs, religious leaders, and other individuals whose language is heard or received as written, by many more people than others have a greater influence.  However, the greatest influence of all, is the existence of traumatic events that affect everyone, to the extent that many people are all talking, at roughly the same time, about some phenomenon or other.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	As I see it, though, there are more than just observable consequences for language. Thought is language, and so this super-ordinate level of description that is the observable group phenomenon that are contingent upon shared events, repeated events, or outspoken or well connected individuals, can reflect the sub-conscious of the group.  This results in some automaticity of cultural behaviours, fashions as catharsis.  In these interesting times in which we have lived, as my generation, we have observed some of the important consequences, culturally, of that most traumatic event, the second world war, and of the first, as well.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	I was born in 1971, and as I grew up, out of the ashes of the hippy movement emerged the phoenix of the youth culture of the punks, skins and mods.  When one examines them in the manner of some abstract description of cultural catharsis of the greater number, then one can see these separate groups as instantiations of the cultural stress that existed as a consequence of many peaceable, normal members of society, being drafted into a war that left them experiencing a form of hell.  The uniforms become obvious.   Then one sees the brightly coloured mohicans, and realises that that is the conscious expression of a terrifying image, as blood spurted from the head of the soldier next to you, from the head of your friend.  It is not without precedent.  The Spartan forces in classical Greek times, wore mohicans, most likely for a similar reason.  The skinheads, with their boots, and shaved heads, were most likely the image of the American or German forces, with the shaved head.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	I think it is probably part and parcel of an inheritance of some evolutionary prerogative, where the group is safer if the growing children of the generation that fight in some war, are more potentiated, in general, to be violent, so that if there is another attack, that generation are prepared.  The Brighton clashes documented in the film Quadrophenia, to the football hooliganism, was the wave of traumatic memory surging through the ‘group mind’.  As millions took to the beaches in the 1970s and the 1980s, to sit and get a tan, thousands of ill fated soldiers landed at the D-Day beaches.  I mean to point out that it is a dynamic system, so one can state that two events, separated by time, actually occur together, rather than being causally contingent on one another.  One can consider a dynamic system, where isomorphically similar states are occurring at different times but in ways that affect one another, under the rubric of a ‘holistic’ system. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	Another interesting phenomenon, and I am sure there exist many, relates to the influence of the Roman Empire on later society.  The Roman Empire started life as a very different political form, which was that of a republic of autonomous, self ruled countries, adhering to Roman standards as they did.  The instantiation of an Emperor, is something that I suggest was engaged in for reasons of security.  Whilst that is a conversation for another book entirely, I think that what happened was that Rome, as an influence, went from republic to empire, to Christian empire, ruled by the papacy, and ultimately the pope.  This ‘shape’ has had an impact on later attempts to make similar structures.  When Napoleon formed his empire, he replaced the republic. Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte did the same thing.  Other republics give way to empires in the history of Europe, or suggest themselves as Republican in nature, but are actually empires, such as Hitler’s national socialism, where the empire he forged was anything but national.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	These political shapes, that seem to repeat in terms of their outcome, are influenced, I suspect, being constrained by that powerful and lasting influence that is the Roman Republic/Empire.  This, I think, will prove to be a problem for European Union politics in the long run, in the sense that they will be driven by the dynamic influence of that early, and continued, shape of European union, that is classical Rome and Roman Catholicism.  The assembly of countries that are the 28 member states of Europe, in coming together as a collection of countries, are driven to an expression of Empire, that looks, isomorphically speaking, like Roman Catholicism. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Brussels is a small country, which in European terms, leaves it isomorphic with the papal state of the Vatican.  Whilst many of those member states are keen to engage in contemporarily acceptable polices that might be seen as left wing, like accountability, and human rights, the bias that operates on their expression of political union, where it is that Christian empire, is one of faith before reason, where political power is wielded in a stratified manner, that by the nature of its existence, demonstrates nepotism.  There is a rejection of science, of an evidence base, and towards acceptance through convention that is decided by a distant, specialist elite.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	If one were to suggest that the left wing are more interested in openly written social agreements, and the right wing prefer under the table expressions of social organisation and agreement, then one could point to the rise of the right wing in Europe over the last 15 years or so, and suggest that as the European economy crashed in 2008, a sudden, traumatic exposure to poverty may well have stimulated the acceptance in to existence of that bias on political union that is the right wing isomorph of the Roman Catholic system and the papacy.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	Whilst the Roman Catholic church is actually quite open and ready to provide the written justifications for its social contract currently, the decision making process is out of the hands of its ‘electorate’.  Furthermore, it is only recently that that plebiscite has had access to reading and writing, let alone access to those written justifications.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">	So, Brexit is a familiar issue, one of Republican autonomy, vs distant centralised foreign control.   It is an issue that is presented in history in classical Rome with the transition from a republic to an empire, and also, more recently with the reformation.  These events are ‘traumatic’ as they stand out from the background of events, sufficient for them to be discriminable as distal isomorphs of one another. So, return to the description that I made at the beginning of this chapter.  That human social psychology can be analysed using a connectionist metaphor, because we internalise the behaviours, linguistic or otherwise, of others, summing the input in order to arrive at some complex threshold determinant that will leave us acting.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">Abnormal psychology is something of a misnomer, following the introduction of positive psychology, a take on psychology that looks at the positive things that one gains as a result of an episode, I prefer to think of people who are experiencing mental health episodes as 'normal people, behaving normally, in a difficult environment'.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When one examines this statement with an understanding of the theory of multiple environments one can appreciate that that difficult environment might be the social environment, or the internal physical environment or the environment of families generally and the environment of their family.  It may well be some of the many other environments, perhaps those that are not necessarily the normal currency of psychological literature with regards to a search for causation. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In any situation, the task demands of one environment may cause too much of a load to be able to successfully process other task demands. There may, for instance, be interference between isomorphically similar environments at the neural level, perhaps if the individual is in one of those environments that, at some level of structure, demonstrates isomorphy with the environment in which <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">some</span> traumatic episode occurred.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The definition, of mental health issues as a ‘normal person, behaving normally, in a difficult environment’, whilst objectively true at the level of cognition, at least from a materialist point of view, should, at a more abstract level, if it finds common usage, help to remove the stigma that surrounds the subject, particularly if one accepts that that difficult environment can be subsumed under the definition of environments, from the theory of multiple environments.  After all, it can be a difficult physiological environment, although to find such a thing in isolation of problems in the person's social environment, and perhaps financial environment etc., is unusual.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the next section of my book, I will work my way through some mental health conditions that might be amenable to a materialist definition.  I will limit it to just a few conditions, but I suggest that all mental health conditions can be analysed, under a definition that finds that a common component of all mental health issues is the degree of health that one exhibits with regards to the attentional system.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If one cannot fixate some stimulus, or one cannot maintain one's fixation of that stimulus, then one half of mental health issues, in an abstract sense, are likely to occur.  Positive symptoms of Schizophrenia, Paranoia, Delusions, hallucinations, hearing voices etc. etc., are all contained with in the more extreme definition of that reality.  When a person fixates some stimulus and cannot unfixate from it, the person is likely to experience a series of illnesses that are amongst the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, ranging from depression, through psychopathy, to catatonia<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn6" id="bodyftn6">6</a></span>.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The process of attentional fixation that I described in the section on the cardiovascular system, is, I think, principally implicated in this broad spectrum of conditions, lack of fixation and over fixation.  If one is familiar with members of the mental health community, then one might have noticed that those that smoke, tend to smoke a vast amount of cigarettes, driven to taking butts from the ashtray to try and maintain their intake of nicotine.  What is happening is that as they smoke, the brief spike of the nicotine receptors creates an automaticity of attention, that leaves the individual able to relax their attentional mechanism.  This, in line with the demands of the cognitive economy ‘drive’, leads to them smoking so much.  So, their attentional system is overloaded, and the nicotine gives it some spare room.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Anti-psychotic medications find their currency in this effect, disturbing the attentional system, so that individuals cannot rest on one position sufficient to develop some maladaptive response.  This is the cause of the inability to pay attention that accompanies the medications, as well as both the painful extra-pyramidal side effects and any perceived benefit from taking them.  In disturbing the potentially fixated attentional system, the problem of the local minima in the gradient of descent (see figure 6) is most likely a part of the process of ‘healing’ and, once reorganised, the neural system accommodates into an environment where, by giving way to authority, in the form of the nurses and doctors in the ward, the individual re-adapts into a situation where they are able to defer to others in their social environment. However, the medications are not things that should be taken for the rest of the patient’s life.  They should only be taken for a few weeks after experiencing some mental health episode.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The brief moments of attentional focus, when the patient experiences some resting of their attentional system, such as when they smoke, is, in effect, allowing the attentional system to give way to some exogenous cue.  It is that same process that is the reason why we watch TV, or read fiction, without really taking it in, we surrender ourselves to a safe exogenous cue as part of relaxation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In my last attempt at writing this book, I included a section where I worked through the different conditions that are discussed by the DSM<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn7" id="bodyftn7">7</a></span> 4, and demonstrated how a deficit of attentional fixation, often due to a problem with attentional resource allocation, was most likely the single greatest shared cause of the various psychological issues that are described there.  Also, I came to a conclusion, which was that if you wanted to heal some person of some mental health condition, you could simply hand them the appropriate section from the DSM and say, ‘Don’t do that’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Here, though, I select only a couple of mental health issues to examine, partly for brevity, and partly because I have nothing particularly interesting to say about the conditions that falls within the scope of this book, which is concerned with the physiological, except for the fact that underlying each one, physiologically, is an attentional fixation issue as I have described above.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I can add, though, to the suggestion of adrenal exhaustion, which I have expanded upon by stating that stress, particularly, affects the thixotropic mass of fat surrounding the distal convoluted tubules of the nephrons of the kidneys.  My addition, which I believe is also a novel suggestion, is that there are, contained within the body, many thousands of miles of cardiovascular passages, arteries, veins and capillaries.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The ability to fixate the blood onto that section of the brain where it is of use to cognition is a fundamental part of good psychological health, and the feedback that maintains that fixation is an essential part of that process.  When, during a panic attack, or some other high period of stress, there is a prolonged experience of high blood pressure, one can find, I suspect, that the cardiovascular system experiences ‘stretching’ where it permanently dilates in a way that following that period of stress, the stretching is not accounted for by the neural system.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As a result of this, neural fixation of the cardiovascular resources is either diminished in its likelihood or, most likely, made more of a demanding task, which then leaves the adrenals stressed.  Because the neural system has largely stopped adapting and accommodating to new phenomena after the point at which the post pubescent growth spurt has finished, which is at about the point the human is almost 25 years old, it is most likely, I might suggest, that any extreme panic like stress is more likely to do us damage when we are after that age.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Consequently, I might daringly suggest that the reason our society has us slowing down from our mid twenties onwards, is because we have reached the age when we prefer to not to take too much risk, a measure of the adrenal glands having settled into a more or less fixed state.  Perhaps.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, the neural feedback on good attentional health, may be affected by a stretching of the cardiovascular system.   In that case, what about other events that damage the cardiovascular system?  Blockages of the intra-cranial cardiovascular system? What about arteriosclerosis, multiple sclerosis or sclerosis of the liver?  I am certain that this model that makes the observation about the importance of attention, can lead to a useful characterisation of the types of and reasons for stressors in the lives of different individuals.  Alcoholism, for instance, with its sclerosis of the liver, is co-morbid with depression.   I consider alcoholism to be potentially a special case of PTSD, which I examine when I look at that particular problem, in chapter 28.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is worth keeping in mind the dictum that all normality is psychosis, i.e. that normality is simply a psychosis that is preferred by the majority.  Each and every nation, every religion, every group identity that one cares to mention, can be viewed under this rubric, that the demands placed on the individual by each group identity require the individual to be able to immerse themselves in the psychosis that is the state of that group psychological identity.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">To accept that normality is a psychosis, one must first appreciate what is meant by psychosis.  It is a state of mind that is accepted based upon no real inspection of the environment, where its acceptance affords cognitive economy the opportunity to allow the mind and body to settle and relax.  When the reality of that accepted state of mind is challenged, the body and mind responds violently, catharcising the sudden stress of having to rearrange its cognitive landscape in order to be able to generate the effort necessary to move into some other place.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the case of normality, it is a shared psychosis.  We tend to rail stressfully against any too immediate or unjustifiable demand to change our normality in some way, just as the definition of psychosis might suggest.  There are other shared psychoses, but shared by smaller interest groups.  Religion is an obvious one, but so is political orientation, or music tastes, or nation etc. etc.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Any state of individual psychosis that one might care to consider, is, I largely suspect, reliant in its apparent existence on the hydraulic properties of the blood, as when the blood is <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">less</span> viscous due to increased <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">mineralocorticoid</span> release, a state that is effectively equivalent to, or rather an analogue of, a greater level of pressure hydraulically occurs and the tonal distance between attentional features that stand out from the background is increased or decreased, and not necessarily in a stable or predictable way sufficient for that information to be useful in diminishing stress during cognitive processing.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Another view of a potential cause for the violence associated with psychosis occurs, albeit still with respect to a sudden and stressful catharsis of cognitive stress related to its inability to resolve the task demands between its accepted norm and the norm that is expected.  This is when two different ‘modules’ of mind, in the sense coined by Jerry Fodor, in his book ‘Modularity of Mind’, are tasked to represent some construct in a way where the attentional system’s cardiovascular resources are divided between these incongruent vectors, towards those modules.  The brain then has to send blood to both areas, both modules, at the same time, where they, in their different locations, represent the same construct.  The resource allocation of cardiovascular resources becomes so overloaded that the individual suddenly experiences a type of adrenal profile of mineralocorticoid release, that is categorically labelled as aggression, most probably because the neural assembly underlying the to be expressed response is not ‘foveated’ effectively enough.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the case of group psychoses, it could be established that the analogue of less viscous blood could be increased speed of communication.  In the second case, where resource competition between two different unresolvable ‘modules’ is the potential cause, it could be suggested that any group might experience the occurrence of separate opinions and sub groups forming.  The ultimate resolution to any war is the peace that follows, in which two unresolvable and orthogonal theses have found their synthesis, or not as the case might be.  In the case of the individual, the self is a psychosis, and normality is the group psychosis that the majority prefer to inhabit.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I want to point to the importance of impression management in ameliorating the difficulties of experiencing a mental health condition.  We all live in small communities, whether it is a town or a village.  Cities are made up of villages located next to one another.  Then there are your social groups, familiar or not familiar.  In every case, those groups comprise ‘the other’, where their attitude to the individual matters in terms of the individual’s definition of self.  It is a political battle, that definition, and is fought particularly hard in cases where an individual displays some idiopathic essence of being, that deviates from the comfort of the group norm. It is important, then, to project an image that is consonant with the group expectations, and that, in line with Moscovici’s comments on minority influence, that image is rationally explicable and consistent.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">To that end I suggest something that I call a ‘normative excuse’.  It is a technique that can be used by a person experiencing mental health issues, that can provide the other with an ‘explanation’ of the individual’s behaviour that meets their expectations.  It is a case, not of lying, but keeping impression management in mind, being diplomatic.  So, a person who hears voices, and responds occasionally, can wear a Bluetooth ear piece, so that any one noticing that individual talking to themselves, will be able to walk away from that observation with a socially ‘acceptable’, safe, explanation.  That he or she was on the phone.  Having thought out  loud, during some intense conversation or other, a person with mental health issues can manage their impression by using some phrase, just in case someone is listening, that frames the discussion as ‘being on the telephone’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Also, talking to oneself, is as unhelpful to the individual as an explanation, as ‘hearing voices’.  In the first instance, one is thinking out loud.  In the second, one is having thoughts that are experienced as external to ones’ self.  When one focuses the individual’s experience on ‘thinking out loud’, or ‘not voices, but thoughts’, then one is moving the locus of control of that experience, to a place where the individual is increasingly empowered to build a cognitive relationship to those experiences where they can employ greater levels of self control.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If one explains to oneself that one is ‘hearing voices’, on the other hand, then one is moving the locus of control out of one’s own hands, which further disempowers the individual, increasing the chance with which the experience will medicalise the individual.  Having spoken to individuals from time to time, as patient to patient, the phenomenon that is observed of ‘defending’ their rationale by becoming aggressive when challenged about their ‘errant’ beliefs, is certainly something that one encounters.  In that aggressive tone, one is hearing the drive to cognitive economy expressing exasperation at the potential that cognitive reorganisation will be required. It is not that they aren’t amenable to the different explanatory framework, and when meeting someone who is also a patient, and one with a psychology degree, and often with cigarettes to spare, one can slowly introduce the notion, and often the individual will leave the conversation and then slowly, over time, aggregatively, integrate the explanation into their self concept.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, all normality is psychosis, just a psychosis that we prefer to inhabit.  And people with mental health issues are experiencing those issues, not ‘suffering’.  They are transitory states, for the larger part, and where they aren’t it is important to emphasize the positive outcomes that that person is left with in their life.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">And finally, the term ‘Abnormal psychology’ is a specialist term drawn from clinical psychology.  It refers to the fact that people experiencing these issues are outside of some ‘norm’ of behaviour.  However, there is no definable norm, and to attempt to do so is an act of proscriptive definition that is effectively an assault on freedom.  The accepted answer, with the anti-corruption DSM etc., has been to define what can be considered as not normal, yet this still doesn’t offer any real justice, at least for the larger proportion of those individuals who experience those issues for the duration of their life.  In all cases, all people with mental health issues are:<br /></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Normal people, behaving normally, in a sometimes difficult environment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 23:</span><span style="font-size:24.0px"> </span><a id="a909Depression"></a><span style="font-size:24.0px">Depression</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">To describe depression as a subject from the point of view of a materialist description, requires an understanding of bodily states as I introduced in the section on cardiovascular hydraulics above.  It is part of that process that is navigating the environment that I describe in the section on trauma, PTSD and EMDR.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What I suggest is happening in the majority of cases is that the environment is reminding the person of some feature that is reconstituting the feeling of depression, either by reintroducing to the mind some remembered environment that is then causing adrenal stress or that is simply the memory of depression itself.  </p>
      <div style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.0417in">
        <img alt="Image3" class="frameGraphics" id="Image3graphic" src="material_psychology_of_consciousness-img/material_psychology_of_consciousness-img010.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What then occurs is that a bodily state is entered into, as a consequence of the adrenal stress, and that the feeling of that physiological environment is associated with culturally informed depressive behaviours.  These depressive behaviours are so powerful as isomorphic features of a remembered depressive state, that the person's current bodily state becomes powerfully associated with conjuring up the memory of depression. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:14.0px">F<a id="Figure9cycleofdepression"></a>igure 9: vicious cycle of depression</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The most important observation that I have made of this situation is to do with the way in which a connectionist network can become permanently biased by the ‘first impressions count’ i.e. the initial circumstances of any discriminable, neurally represented, body state are one of the, if not the, most powerful biases on later directions taken.  This means that when a person is recovering from depression, as their adrenals change in terms of the power of their activity, a discriminably different bodily state is entered into.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If one can notice that this change has happened then one can engage only in positive behaviours, spotting negative behaviours and not engaging in them.  The new bodily state then no longer conjures up the depressive state.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One has to know not only what is meant by distinct body states, but also what constitute depressive behaviours.  These are not just poor sleep patterns, lack of tidying of one’s home, lack of engagement with tasks, but also verbal behaviours such as depressive thoughts.  Spotting these all of the time is not an easy undertaking, and there are therapeutic schools of psychology <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">that help by</span> encouraging behavioural shaping, as well as the Aaron Beck CBT approach of thought catching and reality testing.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When one examines the sequelae of depression, one finds that adrenal exhaustion is most probably implied.   An inability to taste is a lack of resource laden blood achieving sufficient resolution of the target neurons to give the sensation of taste. Lack of sleep or troubled sleep, even too much sleep in some situations, is again, adrenal exhaustion, where cognitive resources need to be adequately located in the correct position intra CNS for the achievement of a trouble free sleep.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I note from somewhere (now forgotten), that depressive patients report amelioration of feeling when deprived of REM sleep.  When one models cognition keeping in mind PTSD like features of depression, it can indicate that there can be unresolvable neural sublimation occurring, the neural assembly waking itself up.   This is the central feature, I suspect, of PTSD (where PTSD can be generalised to many different situations, effectively occurring when any unresolvable potentiated neural complex occurs).  So, when asleep, during REM sleep, normally, neural complexes potentiated during the day are <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">resolved</span> to allow them to unwind, clearing the mind for the following day.  What happens in situations of PTSD like issues, is that the unresolvable neural complex cannot be sublimated, and  continues to demand high levels of resources throughout the process of REM sleep.  When the person awakes, they have greater adrenal exhaustion than they had before.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is often noted that along with sleep being difficult or too abundant, that all sense of taste or smell disappears.  Again, I would suspect that the adrenals are not functioning properly, or the adrenal circuit is in error.  It has been observed that the SSRI group of drugs can make a major difference to depression.  This is stated, in the standard theory as the creation of  a situation where there is an increased level of serotonin at the synaptic cleft, between the previous neuron’s dendrite and the next neurons cell body.  The suggestion is that the dendrites that are releasing serotonin into the synaptic cleft, are then scavenging too much of it back into the dendrite. That is the origin of the term SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.  Reuptake is inhibited, and so there is an increased amount of serotonin, which encourages healthy neural activity.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I would suggest that the neurons are scavenging an increased amount of serotonin, because there isn’t a sufficient level of serotonin in general.  I have made the suggestion in this book that the primary source of mineralocorticoids at the adrenal glands, is because serotonin is contained and produced in the stomach, as a consequence of acid digestion of nutrients.  The serotonin is then pushed down the colon, contained in the chyme (digestive juices), by the power of the contractions of the colonic muscles.  The serotonin in the chyme then gathers in the colon near the adrenals and the muscular contractions then push the chyme through into the adrenals, where the serotonin is filtered into adrenalin, aldosterone, testosterone and oestrogen, along with other mineralocorticoids.  These are then released into the blood.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I have observed that a lack of testosterone, and presumably serotonin and the other mineralocorticoids can occur due to low motility of the colon.  The lack of muscular contractions leaves the individual in a state where the chyme does not get forced through to the adrenals with a sufficient amount of power.  I have a condition called ‘diastasis recti’, which is where the cartilage between the ribcage at the sternum dissolves and breaks.  I suspect that this leaves me with less power of muscular contraction and with less testosterone as a consequence.  ‘Diastasis Recti’ occurs often in pregnant women, and I would be interested to see a study comparing incidence of diastasis recti with post natal depression.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In situations where whatever cause results in lowered colonic motility the individual can be left in a state of depression.  This makes sense in a manner of speaking, in the sense that as one considers the hydraulic blocking effect of the mineralocorticoid release by the adrenals for the ‘foveation’ of cardiovascular resources in the central nervous system (the brain), a lack of available mineralocorticoid precursors is going to result in the diminishment of those resources being available as neurotransmitters, and in any case, the stimulus to move that is occurring in the brain as those mineralocorticoids are released is related to the production of movement with regards to the location of food sources – that primary recursively re-described drive, the food drive (or rather, its resolution).</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, it follows that hunger is related to movement, in the sense that when we are hungry, the feeling is caused by a more powerful amount of muscular contractions in the gut, as this increased power is attempting to force the last of the chyme from the previous meal into the adrenals.  When depressed, people often experience a diminishment in hunger, and I have observed personally, that whilst not expressing the emotional consequences of depression, through being aware of the ‘first impressions count’ bodily state explanation, and having made the effort to train only positive behaviours, I have found myself not experiencing depression at all, but also not experiencing hunger at all, for a long period of time.  Eventually, I went on a diet, to the point that I occasionally fasted for a day or two, and my hunger returned.  With my hunger, came an increase in libido.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">With regards to the primary cause of depression, which I suggest is due to an overload of unresolved attentional complexes of the neural assemblies of the central nervous system, and a lack of systemic redundancy at the level of cardiovascular resources, EMDR is indicated, and I will discuss that in chapter 25.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">Good mental health, then, can be usefully related to healthy attentional fixation.  <span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif">This observation is interesting when one considers the plight of people suffering from paranoia.  The visual attention of the human is massively biased in terms of where it will 'snap' to (in the sense of suddenly arriving at the snapped to location almost magnetically) and is particularly biased toward looking at faces in an environment.  </span><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The facial recognition mechanism, which is simply a tuning of the human attentional system that sees an increased bias towards locating faces in the environment, is an evolutionary earlier process, and as such, normally resides in our subconscious experience.  </span><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal">I would suggest that one of the consequences of having a weakened attentional system is that one is more likely to perceive ‘the green man’, i.e. a face in trees, and other natural sources.  The face that is perceived is due to the weakened attentional system leaving more automatic processes as primary in the act of perception.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif">In a situation where the attentional system cannot stabilise and where endogenous attentional mechanisms (or their underlying cardiovascular correlates) are weakened, an individual will find that as they walk through an environment that contains a lot of people, their subconscious attentional system will snap to the faces of the people, and their conscious psychological percept of this physiological process will be that of considering that people are looking at them.  The process of fixating faces is occurring in all of us, as we negotiate the busy shopping precincts, and other populous places, but is firmly located in our sub conscious awareness, when we are healthy.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif">A person who is in a fight/flight situation, however, is more sensitive, and is more likely to be able to perceive the normally sub-conscious-awareness attentional fixation of the faces of others.  As I have stated earlier in the book, our self-awareness increases when we are in that fight/flight state, as a consequence of an evolutionary survival behaviour, of raising our awareness when being hunted, so that we can concentrate, almost subconsciously, forwards whilst running, whilst at the same time paying attention to the space immediately behind ourselves, and paying attention to ourself as well.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif">This behaviour, which was adaptive in that particular EEA (era of evolutionary advantage – a period of time when we stay in a similar environment long enough to acquire lasting traits contingent upon that environment) is no longer adaptive in our current environment.  So, when hunted, and in a pack, we need to be aware of not colliding with others, and in particular with their sensitive parts, their faces for instance.  During the time that we were being hunted, our forward attention was most likely compromised to some extent, and perhaps this is where the inability to make a good attentional fixation stems from during our experience of the fight/flight condition.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif">The subconscious fixation of faces has, I suspect, a position of prime importance to us, since we have, in our evolutionary history, spent quite some time confined in close quarters to other members of our species.  Identifying where the face is, almost automatically, can help us move around on bouncing branches and diminish the chances that we will slap others in the face.  Also, since communication is such a load intensive act of cognitive processing, the automatic location of faces of people, and most likely the sub conscious reconstruction of the neural parts of the percept of those faces, minimises stress on the cognitive system during communication.  The face also conveys a high level of constraining information, during the communicative act, another reason why we are tuned to be able to locate it.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif"> The audiological percept is similar, in that in all humans there is most likely a situation where interpretation of heard language 'snaps' toward a conceptual interpretation that is a consequence of the most efficient or most likely pattern of potentiated phonemes, in the same way that subconscious visual attention ‘snaps’ towards some point of high information in a perceived scene, such as towards the face.   In the case of an individual in a fight/flight situation, the process is most likely biased by the individual's necessary building up of their ego (in the lay sense of the term – self-directed attention) in order to survive their difficult situation, where they end up relating information to themselves, at a time where they are particularly self conscious.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As the brain functions, a healthy level of attention is necessary in order to be able to fixate concepts by fixating a structural location internal to the brain, supported by the adrenal complex and mineral corticoid release, as mentioned in chapter 4.  As a neural complex that represents a certain piece of information is fixated, it comes into awareness.  Just as visual attention 'snaps' into place, internal attention is likely to 'snap' into place; neurological complexes that represent information centre around <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">cardiovascular areas with greater cross sectional area</span> that represent gross physiological movements that are necessary for survival.  The neurological complex  becomes finer grained as movements as one moves away from the immediate job of surviving.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Neural complexes though, if one recalls the earlier chapter, have more oblique, angular, and potentially violent expressions of the to be elicited behaviour in the neurons around the edge of the centre of the cloud of neurons that makes up the prototypical exemplar of the behaviour.  So, when a person is not fixating that prototypical exemplar in that cloud of neurons in a stable enough way, attention will not only veer and ‘wobble’, in a sudden and jerky manner, but the person will feel the impact of the bias of the more violent expressions of other neural complexes.  When particularly sensitive, the person will <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">experience</span> the consequences of poorly fixated complexes as paranoia.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal">If one were to explain the process of paranoia, as spelt out in this chapter, to individuals before they experienced that situation of fight/flight, would they then have a normative explanation for the phenomenal experience that is healthier than thinking that people are looking at them?  Would they then have more insight?  Would they be able to make a correct attribution of cause?  I suspect that eventually the answer would be yes, although as people suffer, they tend to build the ego (in the lay sense of the term) to try and compensate and as a result often experience that bias toward relating information to themselves.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">More on topic, in a situation where the person is experiencing the automaticity of attentional mechanisms that same consequent impact is observed as where a mental health patient becomes addicted to nicotine, as I discuss in the introduction the section on ‘Abnormal Psychology’.  During the situation of automaticity of attentional mechanism in attending, due to exogenous cue, to some feature of the environment, the automaticity appeals to the cognitive economy ‘drive’ of the cognitive mechanisms.  These then become increasingly drawn, in the manner of an addiction, to re-experiencing that process of automatic attentional mechanism, and the person experiences, again and again, that process of paranoia, i.e. the conscious observation of the normally subconscious process, leading to a misattribution of cause.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal">This process is isomorphic with that underlying the ‘magnetic’ snapping towards concepts of attention.  As intra CNS attention finds itself moving towards the foveation of some neural complex, or as visual attention (or any other modality) finds itself moving towards some feature of the perceived environment, the acceleration profile of its movement is not linear, but exponential.  As it reaches the zenith of the exponential, it ‘snaps’ into place.  In the case of delusional paranoia, the individual is experiencing a fight/flight build up of their ego, in the evolutionary sense of heightened self awareness, which is causing cognitive economy to further ‘snap’ concepts into places where that increasingly outlined ego is demanding that concepts be related to the self.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">This ‘snapping’ of attention, which has a profile that is exponential and a tendency to relate information to the self, as an act of referential deixis, becomes extremely maladaptive when the person can be thought of as delusional.  In this state, the speed of processing of information by the neural system is moving too fast for the person to be able to separate themselves from the immediate interpretation of the chain of foveated biases.  Their cognition becomes so speeded, that the distance between conceptual boundaries of concepts within their self narrative, become diminished, until there exists no possible ability to interrupt the flow of attention.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal">So, in the delusional state, the person is in a state of heightened awareness, resulting from fight/flight, where they relate information to themselves, and where the process of foveating conceptual neural complexes is so fast as to be automatic.  The chain of foveated conceptual neural complexes is then interpreted in whatever way makes sense to the individual, which is often a process of interpretation that is guided by cognitive economy which selects the interpretation that requires the least expenditure of effort.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">Hearing voices is type of delusion that, like many other mental health issues, is a consequence of not having a sufficient amount of attentional resources to be able to foveate the constraints upon good neural foveation.  I surmise that there is a lack of attentional resources, due to attentional resources being used up in service of some traumatically self reinstigating complexes, as a result of traumatic experience.  Another consequence of that traumatic experience, where nefarious sexual advances are made to the victim, in a trauma inducing manner, is the diminishment of testosterone.  With a diminished amount of this hormone, the cardiovascular system is less efficient at foveating neural correlates of conceptual complexes.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal">Since language as a process is so resolutely built around a principal food drive, as I discussed in chapter 13, when some stressful experience occurs for a long enough period, stress hormones can damage the internal motility of the stomach.  Another cause of diminishment of internal motility of the stomach can be unwanted and traumatic penetration, either vaginally, or anally.  In either case the sympathetic neural response at the other ‘end’ of the colon is decreased motility as the sphincter, as part of the process of its muscular function, recalls the traumatic incident</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">.  C</span><span style="font-weight:normal">onsequent decreased motility, I reason, leaves a diminished amount of pressure available to push mineralocorticoids through to the adrenals.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">I think it likely that all neural complexes in the brain can be thought of as self-reinstigating to some extent, where traumatic complexes are extremely powerful, unsublimatable versions of that more general process.  Most neural complexes, which are potentiated but not resolved during the day, resolve at night during REM sleep, but traumatic complexes are the exception to this.  They are present the day afterwards, and build up to the point at which they eat into cardiovascular resources. This leaves the person who has PTSD, experiencing too many cardiovascular resource utilising neural complexes.  The lack of cardiovascular resources available to complex neurally intensive feats such as social processing, leaves the individual experiencing mental health issues.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">I think, also, that the way in which sphincter muscles contract and dilate is probably the evolutionary ‘cause’ of the circular process of neural complexes.  So, all species with sphincters most likely will have some capacity to demonstrate neural complexes that stay present when formed.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">On the subject of hearing voices, with a permanently diminished amount of attentional fixation, where the food drive may locate some constraint, the other end of the act of recursive redescription, ‘waves’ around, leaving intra cranial neural correlates of concepts poorly fixated. The consequence is where the experience of thought finds itself located as an external source.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">Recall that thought is language where the tongue and other overt speech mechanisms are inhibited.  The activity of the neural correlates of the physical activity of the tongue and other speech effectors makes up what we perceive as thought.  However, this process becomes dissociative, due to the cardiovascular resources arriving too slowly at some of the constraining neural complexes, most probably because the cardiovascular resources are being used by some continuously existent traumatic complex.  The consequence is to experience thought as originating not from the self but from some other.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">This follows, as it happens, as the ‘self’ at the level of attention, can be thought of as the summation of all endogenous forms of control yet when fight/flight is occurring, and the person becomes more driven by cognitive economy, in the brain with diminished amounts of attentional resources due to experience of traumatic incidents, the process of cognition is occurring so quickly and so resolutely in the clutches of exogenous biases, that the self is not attributable as a cause of the process of consciously experienced thought.  Effectively, one can use this example of behaviour to further limit the definition of the self, to that set of endogenous biases that can interrupt automatic, exogenously driven biases, at least potentially.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal">In the above discussion I have referenced the fight/flight experience as a cause of the issues pertaining to that moment when one is consciously aware of a subconscious process.  I suspect, though, that when a person is lacking in attentional resources, due to, let’s say, some experience of PTSD creating a traumatic self repeating cycle of neural assembly excitation that then consumes too many attentional cardiovascular resources, the process of increased self awareness occurs. </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal">The fight/flight situation is actually, I suspect, a temporary but comparable situation to that where an individual is experiencing a long term lack of cardiovascular resources due to some drain, such as in PTSD.  I discuss PTSD, and also EMDR, a cure for PTSD, in the next chapter.  Fight/flight though, is probably a situation where so many traumatically established neural complexes are present simultaneously, that the amount of spare cardiovascular resources underlying conscious attentional processing is so diminished that the speed of delivery of cardiovascular resources increases to meet the needs of the automatic PTSD traumatic complexes, and that increased speed of blood arriving at the other neural complexes underlies the fight/flight experience that is the delusional state.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">The speeded cardiovascular resources would also be delivered with less integrity, in terms of accurate foveation of neural complexes by the cardiovascular resources, and the consequence would be jerky, sudden movements, and an increased chance of instant committal to act.  Consider the utility of this state to us in earlier evolutionary guises, when encountering some environment in which we have met predators before.   More about this general process in the next chapter, on Trauma, PTSD, and EMDR.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal">The paranoid or delusional individual is simply an individual who is behaving in a normal way, given the environment that they are in.  All other people would behave in the same way, given their presence in that total environment, inclusive of the physiological response that is fight/flight situation.  If one recalls the chapter on dreams, the process of interpretation of the foveated concepts is similar to the way in which the cognition makes sense of the chain of neural concepts that are ‘unwinding’ as REM sleep takes place.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">So my observation still holds, that the term 'abnormal psychology' is a badly conceived misnomer.   People with mental health issues, are 'normal people, behaving normally, in a difficult situation'.  In the case of fight/flight, or delusional reasoning, which often is accompanied by fight/flight, they have a different physiological environment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-weight:normal">It should be possible to address that physiological environment by first addressing whatever experience it is that is diminishing available attentional resources, through EMDR perhaps.  Then good adrenal and cardiovascular health should be pursued and when they have greater attentional redundancy, they should be encouraged to practise thought catching and reality testing, attempting to notice behaviours that are symptomatic of their illness, and then filtering them out.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:24.0px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter 25:</span> <a id="a9091TraumaPTSDEMDR"></a>Trauma, PTSD and EMDR</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Trauma is, as a word, often taken to mean some event or experience that is negative in its overall impact.  I prefer to imagine, and I suspect as the Greeks did, when they described it in classical times, that trauma is connotatively free of positive or negative, or other judgements, simply describing some event or experience that means that it stands out from the background.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I think that the process of standing out from the background, is available to the cognitive system at the level of the perceptual neurons i.e. a sudden change of property in the neuron is a traumatic change.  When a line of neurons is excited in that traumatic way, then an edge is being described.  When a sudden explosion happens, that explosion is traumatic, in that it stands out from the background.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Other features of the environment are not coded so instantly, although they stand out none the less.  There, their form as an edge, perhaps, is recalled by the fact that they are regularly perceived in that same location.  When one is alerted to some feature of the environment that is regular, one has to, potentially, engage in some processing of how that regular feature might be salient to the job of cognitively existing, so, cognitive effort is raised when one sees any feature that is either expected or unexpected.  It is simply that that feature stands out from a background that allows it to be of potential use in becoming part of a framework for recall of the environment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In any case where a traumatic stimulus occurs, whether it is at the level of the neurons, or if it is a psychological trauma, the neural 'imprint' of that trauma, including features of the environment in which it occurs, are 'stored' by being kept alive, by a process of re-inspection of the current environment for those features that are part of that environment in which the trauma occurred.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I refer to this neural process, as a traumatic cycle (described in its own chapter, chapter 6).  In the case of the perceptual process of detecting edges with the retina or fingers, the traumatic cycle allows the short term storage of the features that it is detecting, long enough for the determination of a feature set, such as an edge, or corner for instance.  I mean to imply that there are 'levels' of traumatic process of perception in between the perceptual detection of simple features, and the psychological level.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">At the gross psychological level, though, the person experiences a traumatic cycle, i.e. the continuous re-inspection of the environment, that  examines the feature set of the current environment, comparing it to the feature set of the environment in which the trauma occurred.  One can describe proximal traumas, i.e. those that occurred recently, and distal traumas, those traumas that occurred a long time ago.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the case of gross distal or proximal traumas, the traumatic cycle, which can be effectively stated as 'just because you can't see it, doesn't mean that it isn't there', leaves the individual in a situation where the available resources to the cardiovascular innervation of the central nervous system, are eaten up by the requirements of the traumatic cycle.  The neural system cannot tell whether the presence of some feature is likely to re-occur, so, if that feature stands out from the background, then the neural system saves time by keeping that feature ‘alive’ neurally.  This leads to many false positive traumatic cycles i.e. neural complexes that initiate their own firing as part of their resolution, thus ‘staying alive’, which are later de-potentiated during sleep, a process that contributes to dream states, as I described in chapter 15.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The effect of traumatic cycles is additive as a drain on cardiovascular resources to the brain, and, if sufficient, perhaps when some traumatic cycle or traumatic cycles are continuously present, the individual loses the ability to successfully process events that are necessary to process in order to negotiate the normal flow of daily events; the available cardiovascular resources are consumed already.  One of the consequences is, I greatly suggest, a range of different mental health issues, perhaps the entire catalogue.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As I stated in the introduction to Part C, it is attentional issues that are at the heart of most, if not all, mental health issues.  I have introduced some interesting insights in the course of writing this book, but this is of particular importance.  It effectively locates the fundamental causal variable that is shared by all mental health issues at the adrenal glands.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, where there are traumatic consequences that are displayed by those suffering PTSD from recent experiences of explosions etc, those individuals are displaying a behaviour that is the exaggeration of a normally occurring process.  That process is one which allows us to inspect features of our normal environment, using those features that stand out from the background, particularly the salient features, to code the environment for later recall.  The distance between those salient features becomes at least one piece of important information as the process of neural sublimation occurs.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When we walk across our bedroom, with no shoes or socks on our feet, and we kick something, stubbing our toe, the sudden jar upon our attentional mechanism, leaves our attentional system suddenly drawn to that location the next time we cross our bedroom.  That sudden drawing of our attention to a location of potential danger is a type of PTSD.  Normally, I suspect, that sudden movement of attentional resources that is stimulated by us flowing through our environment continues, but becomes less available to conscious awareness, the more we repeat the behaviour without stubbing our toe.  It still continues to exist, though, as a traumatic cycle, otherwise we would not be able to learn to navigate an environment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Where the traumatic cycle begins to disappear from awareness in the case of stubbing one’s toe, or learning the date of the battle of Trafalgar, or any other form of learning, of which PTSD is a subset of, other traumatic cycles diminish less so, and the impact of their continued maintenance can be spotted in individuals.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I refer to this type of prolonged PTSD as distal PTSD, generally being obvious as a maintained traumatic cycle in situations of PTSD where the causal ‘drama’ has occurred many years before.  The people who experience this distal PTSD, often have co-morbid mental health issues, and often disappear into attentional fugue states, their eyes glazing over, as they are in the middle of discussion or interaction with an other.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I was one of these people, having been a victim of long term child sexual abuse when I was younger.  Many of my issues began from the point at which I first told other people about my experiences.  <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">T</span>here was, in no small way, a real issue with vigilantism, using, in an ill informed way, a de-libidinising agent on any victim who dared to speak out, which, for some convoluted reason in the minds of the vigilantes, left them believing that they were doing society a favour, seeing the person who spoke out as a potential threat, in the manner of someone bitten by a werewolf turning to a werewolf themselves, and then de-libidinising the victim as a precaution to defend children.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This action, de-libidinising any person who spoke out, in my opinion, left the victims with less endogenous power, and so less able to resist the impact of exogenous biases, and where they had been openly accused, they then fought with less agency in defeating the consequences of an overstressed mimetic process of learning, and, de-libidinised, were less able to abstract themselves from the traumatic cycle initiated by the trauma of the open accusation, and then went on to become abusers as a matter of catharcising the stress, creating some rationalisation for their behaviour.  I discuss this in more depth in chapter 26, on the subject of paedophilia.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Effectively, then, the vigilantes caused the paedophilia, and this then left them believing that they were correctly informed, and that the abused abuse, rather than the reality, that the accused abuse (although not all of them), as well as other logically incoherent statements about the emotionally charged subject.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Throughout my twenties, I spent much of my time absorbed in one mental health condition or another that was a consequence of the de-libidinising agent that the vigilantes had at their disposal, before doing the psychology degree, during which I discovered a therapy called eye movement desensitization and reprogramming EMDR.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">EMDR is a non-invasive technique that can be engaged in at home, with the help of a large enough flat screen TV, or similar apparatus.  In my case I saw a therapist, a clinical psychologist who was busy studying the technique formally.  He sat down opposite me, about 5 feet away, and told me to keep my body and head in a fixed position facing him, and then to move only my eyes, from left to right, following a shiny two pence piece that he had glued to a stick.  He held the stick in his lap, and waved it such that it stayed in the same place in his lap, with the other end with the the two pence piece describing an arc, as it moved from side to side in front of me.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I was then told that I should recall a traumatic memory of the events that I considered to be traumatic biases on my mind.   I had been instructed to think of eight or nine prototypical exemplars of these memories, and each memory out of the eight or nine was then recalled, one per session, without telling the clinician anything about it, and simply keeping it in mind, whilst I moved my eyes left and right as I followed the stimulus.  Each memory seemed to ‘float away’ becoming diminished in terms of its substantial realism.  Before I had the sessions, I always had a permanently ruminating sotto voce, and when I got depressed, I would go down into the depths for months at a time.  After the sessions that I had, I was able to relax and clear my mind, and when I got depressed, it would be for some portion of the one day, and then I would be back to my normal chipper self the next day.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">EMDR has been considered as finding its efficacy from flooding, but I propose a different description, in materialist terms, one that seems most likely.  What happens in the case of distal PTSD is that the environment in which the initially traumatic issue occurred is sublimated over time, such that the features of isomorphically similar environments then encourage the reconstitution of that initial environment in memory.  The recall subconsciously of that initial environment leaves the brain inspecting for the source of danger, and, unable to find it, reinspecting the subconscious environment.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The resulting traumatic cycle then requires so much in the way of attentional resources, that the victim of distal PTSD often goes into a glazed-over-eyes fugue state, due to the high level of attentional processing that the traumatic cycle is incurring.  It may be that unable to sublimate, since it is reinforcing itself, it may spawn new neural assemblies as copies of itself, to try and aid sublimation, where the additive drain on resources of all the neural assemblies would be more than the brain can healthily manage.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What EMDR is doing is creating the highest possible isomorph that might be experienced of that traumatic environment, in the form of the imagined memory of that environment, and, where that prototypical exemplar of that environment stimulates the traumatic cycle, the eyes are busy being involved in the process of both endogenous attention, i.e. deliberately following the shiny stimulus, as well as exogenous attention, to the extent that the shiny two pence piece is capable of attracting attention.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Both endogenous and exogenous attentional mechanisms are then involved in a movement, attentionally, that is incompatible with the traumatic cycle, but which the imagined memory incurs more powerfully than it can recall the traumatic cycle of inspecting the environment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Following the therapy, the individual may walk into some environment that would have stimulated through isomorphy, the recall of that traumatic environment.  It still does stimulate the recall, but as that environment is recalled, where it stimulates the return of the traumatic cycle, that traumatic cycle is prefixed by the EMDR trained exogenous and endogenous movements, and instead of being an unbroken traumatic cycle, is processed as a normal environment.  With the greatly diminished draw on attentional resources, the individual is then able to negotiate the environment without experiencing the associated mental health issues, the lack of self esteem, the lack of self confidence, depression, or more serious health conditions etc.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I would hope to engage in research regarding this technique, as it may be of importance to increasing the efficacy of the treatment.  I can suggest already, that any patient who wants to engage in the therapy should be presented with a therapist who has not been exposed to the patient’s case history in any way.   This is because that in disclosing the issues to a therapist, the therapist becomes coded into the experienced environmental recall, and so, if you tell the therapist your difficult memories, then during the EMDR the therapist becomes a stimulus to reacquire the traumatic cycle. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This issue doesn’t present a problem where a computer program is used to present a dot on a large enough flat screen TV or a mobile phone presented as virtual reality goggles etc.  I would be interested to see if research can consider manipulating the strength of exogenous attraction that might be represented by the ‘dot’ that is presented on the screen.  Rather than a dot, for example, one might consider presenting a yantra, an Indian device that has spiritual connotations, but which is often a form that is capable of attracting attention powerfully.<a id="Figure10yantra"></a></p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">Furthermore, distal traumas are not the only type of traumatic cycle that can be treated using EMDR.  The clinician who administered EMDR to me, gave me EMDR for my exam stress, and the next time I had exams, I faced them with a calm collected self confidence that allowed me, for the first time in years, to address the exam situation properly.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I have been contemplating PTSD and what I call distal PTSD, from the point before I left university, across a period of time when I have largely been surrounded by mental health service users.  This environment has allowed me to continue reasoning in a reasonably ecologically valid manner about the subject.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Recently, I have chanced upon a discussion of CPTSD, which stands for Complex PTSD.  This field describes what I term distal PTSD, and erroneously, in my opinion, suggests that there are differences between PTSD and CPTSD.  I support the idea that the differences are superficial.  Furthermore, I think that CPTSD, being separated from PTSD is an unhealthy over extension of definition, since the majority of ‘symptoms’ of CPTSD, which are symptoms of distal sublimated PTSD, are far too broad reaching and possibly conflated with many other causes.  The symptoms seem to disregard depression and other commonly medicated for issues, in order to separate CPTSD treatable by EMDR, from the enormous drug market that is sponsored by distal PTSD, it occurring on a kline of severity, to all people to one degree or another.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Furthermore there is a fixation by the definer, upon complexes that might be shown by any victim, and that allow a negative image of the victim to be drawn.  The ‘symptoms’ draw a picture of the survivor of sexual abuse, for instance, that is an entirely negative image, creating a stigma that is an extra barrier to the survivor, in terms of their right to stand up and declare their normality.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Symptoms and case history are unnecessary to draw, since they are all consequences of one thing, which is an attentional system that is overloaded by an unresolvable process of neural sublimation, due to the traumatic cycle reawakening the neural assembly which is in the process of sublimating.  So, when some patient presents him or herself to a clinician, that clinician does not need to obtain a case history, since PTSD can be caused by many different issues, from historical child sexual abuse to not getting the fashionable trainers at Christmas.  This diminishes the clinician as a source of blackmail or other uses for deliberately elicited criminal uses of sensitive knowledge about an individual (such as for hypnosis).  It also means that a person can be cured of the negative symptoms caused by enduring PTSD before making up their mind about whether or not to discuss what happened, either with a clinician or the police.  Without the permanent drain on their attentional resources, they are far less emotionally mercurial and far better able to make a rational judgement about such a thing.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One of the consequences of PTSD associated with mental health issues is that as a person relates their experiences in some talking therapy session, they then re-experience the traumatic environment, and can become almost exhausted with having to devote what little attentional resources they have left to the business of engaging with the practitioner.  So, EMDR is a non invasive therapy, in every sense of the phrase ‘non-invasive’, since a practitioner does not have to invade a client’s personal and often sensitive experience.  EMDR should be presented by a clinician as an initial stage of therapy.  If it is successful, then the client may lose their depression or other associated mental health conditions, due to the greatly diminished draw on cognitive resources.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal">It could be argued that it is the unsublimatable neural complexes in our subconscious that are the anchors of our self, and often revolve around experiences that we had that were difficult to resolve such as those that left us feeling guilty or threatened, as well as revolving around positive memories as well.  Positive memories are often stress free, and so they sublimate without problem, but keeping them alive are near negative issues that stimulate their recall.   Ultimately, as the brain translates desire into action, the drive to action is biased by those permanent biases, where those permanent biases become anchors as constraints on the recreation of some ‘familiar’ neural assembly.  So, those permanent biases result, at least in part, in our own personal identity, our personal spin on those actions.  The soul, defined, to some extent.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal">To finish this chapter, I want to remind the reader that there are many, many thousands of veterans of warfare, especially in the United States at the moment, but across many nations unfortunately, that suffer from PTSD.  EMDR should offer some effective treatment for that condition in those survivors.  They, as men, are often faced with a vision of psychological ‘talking’ therapies that are quite overtly feminine in nature, or spiritual, which is also, effectively, feminine.  Presenting the survivors of war with the description of the process of efficacy of EMDR that I describe in this chapter, should be a less emasculating process than the lack of definition that accompanies the spiritual overtones of meditation or the rather overtly feminine holistic therapies.  They should also benefit from less medication, which is often extremely painful and not a great deal of help.</span><br /></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><a id="a9092EMDRandAddictions"></a><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px">Chapter 26:</span> <span style="font-size:24.0px">EMDR and Addictions</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A type of issue that I think might be amenable to EMDR, is addictions, in particular, alcoholism.  With regards to alcoholism, the brain is an efficient shepherd.  When it tastes alcohol, it tastes a material that it knows will deliver large amounts of fat and sugar to the neural complex that needs it, and that because it thins the blood, it will deliver that fat and sugar more efficiently or at least more rapidly, if it uses alcohol, than any other substance.  The brain then chooses alcohol, often more powerfully than the person is able to resist, since alcohol presents itself to the brain in that way that leaves the brain’s cognitive economy strongly attracted to alcohol.  At its worst, this leaves the person subject to the brain’s demands to the extent that eating a healthy diet is exchanged purely for alcohol, and damage to the body and brain ensues.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">W</span>hen a person enters into an environment, that environment stimulates a response based upon the experience that that person has had in that environment.  In the case of PTSD, the environment, reminds the person of the traumatic experience that they had in that environment previously, and a traumatic complex occurs.  This traumatic complex starts to eat up attentional resources and does not diminish, even as that environment is exited.  Where attentional resources are limited, alcohol appeals to the brain, by being able to fulfill the demands of the brain’s metabolism, by supplying sugary fat quickly, by thinning the blood.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0">	So the alcoholic experiences some environment that then stimulates a craving for alcohol.  The craving, stimulated, is the PTSD response.  Alcoholism is often associated with traumatic episodes, and the danger, that cannot be discounted as existing, is the self.  EMDR should be able to dissociate the problematic response, i.e. the craving, from the environment.  It should be kept in mind that that environment may well include a body state that is already replete with alcohol, so EMDR may be more efficaciously administered if the alcoholic has imbibed some alcohol.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Most, if not all individuals who find themselves experiencing addiction, will most probably have some experience of distal PTSD induced by historical trauma.  Over and above any distal PTSD the general experience of addictions is a source of PTSD itself, with many episodes of a traumatic nature experienced by the ongoing addict. Many alcoholics are experiencing their alcoholism as a secondary addiction that they have acquired due to their use of harder drugs, such as heroin or cocaine, which they have taken at the same time as alcohol, at some point.  These situations may mitigate against the success of EMDR.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the case of stronger drugs, the drive to resolve their addictions, is stronger, I hypothesise, than their food drive, and their entire moral universe changes from being supported through recursive re-description of the food drive, to one of developing recursive re-description of the drive to resolve their addiction.  This leaves addicts in a situation where they are at the beginning of establishing the laws of acquisition of their substance, i.e. the resolution of their drive, and, as a consequence, their moral decision making process is in a situation where they are prone to violence, theft or other situations that are effectively neanderthal, in a sense.  The addicts exist, in terms of their relationship with their drive, in a situation that we were in relative to the food drive, many tens of thousands of years ago.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">On the subject of illicit drugs, I think that it can be useful to extend the definition of alcoholism presented above to at least cocaine use, where the brain finds that some resource is presented that is so useful in terms of its capacity to aid in the delivery of blood to the neural complexes of the brain, that an automatic exogenous drive is created that becomes stronger than the person’s endogenous ability to control it.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Heroin is different kettle of fish.  One can generally divide illicit drugs into uppers and downers.  Cocaine, which massively ‘lubricates’, reducing the viscosity of the blood, is an example of an upper, and I might go as far as stating that the increase in speed of the blood, due to lowered viscosity, is one of the shared features of all uppers.  Downers, including Heroin, or the similar Methodone, or Morphine, and Opium, Valium etc, all serve, I think, to slow down the heart muscle.  They are addictive rat poison, and the floating feeling associated with them is the blood making only just past the blood brain barrier, and focusing on extremely early evolved brain structures.  The addicts lie prostrate <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">recovering</span> genetic memories of our time as jellyfish, in early, warm seas.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A third category presents itself, which is psychotropics, such as LSD.  There the danger is that the brief but enormously powerful demand for cardiovascular resources to meet the needs of the emergent neural state will cause lasting adrenal exhaustion.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The use of heroin is so frequently the cause of alcoholism, that the majority, if not all former heroin addicts that I have met are alcoholics to one degree or another.  Heroin, like other downers, results in a complex where the individual user is more likely to experience depression, and in this state, any childhood traumas are more likely to be facilitated in terms of their power to become distal traumatic complexes.  The user, depressed, finds escapism to be the rationalisation that supports the behaviour.  <br /><br />Whilst EMDR may offer partial solutions to these issues, it is certainly not the only technique to employ in curing the affected individual.   Breaking the cycle of self abusive linguistic behaviours in sotto-voce is certainly going to be needed, as well as keeping a diary to obviate what environmental triggers exist for the trauma.  Behavioural shaping to avoid the self reinforcing behaviours of depression is important, along with thought catching and reality testing.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Acknowledging the damage done to the liver in terms of the way in which this blocks cardiovascular resources from being delivered to the brain, by ‘updating’ the cardiovascular hydraulic dynamics, in a way that the body cannot ‘understand’ is particularly important, and so a diet that is liver friendly should be established, with plenty of vitamin C and perhaps milk thistle supplements added.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Current treatments for alcoholism expect the individual to engage in complete abstinence, such as the program encouraged by Alcoholics Anonymous.  However, this reduces the potential social life of the individual alcoholic, and with a diminished social life, will experience greater stress, thus forcing them back towards alcohol.  What is needed is a program that encourages a healthy level of self control in the presence of alcohol, something that is known to be virtually impossible currently, hence the prescription of abstinence by the AA.  I hope that EMDR will prove to be able to diminish the attentional resource loss that leads to the decrease in power of endogenous attentional control when confronted with the environment of alcohol.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I include in Appendix A, a handout that I have written that might be potentially able to illustrate to an alcoholic individual how EMDR might help them, and how it might work as a process, with some vignettes to illustrate the types of issues that EMDR may address.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:24.0px"><a id="a9093EMDRandpeadophilia"></a><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter 27:</span> EMDR and Paedophilia</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><br />I suggest that EMDR can be used to treat paedophilia, when the individual is faced with the traumatic consequences of a self accusation, one that might be stimulated, for instance, by other’s treatment of them, or some direct accusation, or simply exposure to the notion that ‘the abused abuse’ as a victim of CSA (child sexual abuse).</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the case of paedophilia, the individual cannot stop thinking subconsciously, traumatised by a self accusation, and the bias on their attention then takes them to a situation, where they seek a logical resolution to the subconscious ‘drive’ in the form of some rationalisation.  The rationalisation does not stop the traumatic cycle of continuous sub-conscious rumination, and eventually the mimetic resolution of identity becomes overloaded, and the individual is unable to separate themselves from the identity that is plaguing them, and then drive resolution steers the individual towards a situation where their drive is resolved.  The ‘craving’ to engage in the behaviour is stimulated by some low level feature of an isomorphic identity due to neural sublimation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I would suggest that one potential source of reinforcing the self-accusation might be the fact that with the traumatic cycle already created, i.e. already having self-accused, the neural bias underlying the traumatic cycle may very well bias eye movements in a way that could be described as a special case of that process that I have suggested as playing a causal role in situations of paranoia, as I describe in chapter 23.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0">	The individual detects their normally sub-conscious attentional inspection of their visual field.  Their sensitivity is caused by the traumatic cycle of self-accusation functioning as a neural bias.  Whenever they pass children they then detect the subconscious movement of attention and then are left making a misattribution of cause, as is the case in paranoia.  This misattribution of cause is then labelled as evidence of some growing nefarious relationship with respect to children.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, EMDR may be able to address the ‘craving’ that presents itself to the individual, and if the individual is able to understand the process outlined in the previous paragraph, then the individual may be able to understand themselves in a way where they are able to make correct attributions of cause for their rumination, rather than arrive at an unhealthy rationalisation for their feelings, i.e. one that then further traumatises them and leads to drive resolution and the potential of an abused child.  There should be the opportunity, developed in society, for any man who is experiencing this process to come forward and in a supportive environment, explain their experience, before it takes them any further towards criminal activity.  However, as I address later in this chapter, there has been a growing witch-hunt, stimulated, in part, by newspaper sales, and so the chances of anyone coming forward are diminished.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I used, earlier, the phrase ‘mimetic resolution’.  It bears further examination.  It is a supposed mechanism by which learning takes place, where an individual learns by internalising the actions of another.  I have discussed language, where the individual internalises the speech of some listened to individual, by ‘copying’ the listened to speech with their tongue (and other speech effectors) neurons, with the overt behaviour inhibited, the inhibition forcing a form of neural catharsis that excites conjoined sensory neural areas of the brain.  Well, the normal path for learning often involves a similar situation where an observed ‘teacher’ enacts some movement, and the ‘student’ then internalises the behaviour by ‘miming’ that behaviour internally with their overt behaviour inhibited, in the same manner as when listening to language.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This is what I refer to when I use the term ‘mimetic resolution’. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The mind is subject to endogenous and exogenous attentional biases, and exogenous attentional biases can often be ‘internal’ to the brain/mind.  If one is continuously worrying about some accusation of potential infidelity with children, then one is creating an exogenous bias internally, that effectively resolves to mimetic resolution, and when this overloads, i.e. it uses more attentional resources than can be brought to bear to overcome the bias, mimetic resolution is forced and the individual identifies with that self image of themselves.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The overloading of mimetic resolution is often the cause of delusional reasoning, messianism etc.  As a recap, try and visualise the cross section of the cardiovascular system as it passes the adrenals.   Note the deformed topographic representation of that cross section describing viscosity differences, in a way that affects the terminal end of that ascending cardiovascular system.  That topographic deformation affects the paths that are taken by the blood as they hit the enormous brachiation (branching) of the cardiovascular system.  In the case of a continuously repeating traumatic cycle, the mineralocorticoids are being released into a situation in that topographic representation, where they affect blood flow to both the traumatically established neural complex, and the neural complexes that are serving to correct for the bias that the traumatic neural complex forms.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Eventually, through adrenal exhaustion, exogenous cues are likely to defeat the endogenous control. Normally, the fact that the establishing neural complexes that seek to defeat the traumatic bias in terms of its effects on behaviour are moving around continuously from place to place, most likely leaves adrenal exhaustion occurring with regard to resources headed towards the traumatic bias.  However, the traumatic bias is traumatic, in part, because it is unresolvable, and even without resources heading its way, will mean that it stays resident, sufficient to be brought ‘back to life’ again when some feature of the passed through environment triggers it into existence.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is more than just vigilantes, leering some praxis based accusation of guilt, to ‘test’ the individual’s response for signs of guilt.  There are situations where a man’s attribution of cause for some behaviour or other might result in a traumatic self accusation.  One of these, is where a man is in the company of his lover and her child from a former relationship.  When that child reaches puberty, the man is in a situation where they are faced with a sudden increase in the expressed pheromones in the environment, and this can lead to automatic erection.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This event is so utterly traumatising in a shameful manner, that very few, if any men speak out about its occurrence.  However, I suspect that there are many step fathers who experience some consequence of their ward reaching puberty, and the pheromonal environment that is created, who experience some automatic stimulation.  Many of them will not think too much of it, and may ignore it, but any of them that then traumatically self accuse, in the process of asking the question ‘could I do such a thing’, may then go on and become an abuser.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The situation is less prevalent with natural parents of the child, and I think that this is because the father represents some similar component of the pheromonal presentation of the child and vice versa, which is then less likely to stimulate automaticity of response in the father.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">There has been a growing ‘witch hunt’ across Britain, over the last 40 years.  It’s inauguration has coincided with the legalisation of homosexuality, not that the two are related in anyway, but that at least some section of British society, found that the legalisation of homosexuality was a traumatic event in itself, and their recourse was to justify their homophobia by recourse to stating that children were unsafe around these individuals who were considered to be ‘sex freaks’.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Thankfully, that adamant opinion has virtually disappeared from British society, but I think that it served to increase the force with which we experienced the ‘peado witch hunt’.  This inherited the evolution of the home guard, which had eventually become neighbourhood watch schemes, frequently populated by individuals using it as an excuse for their racist sentiments.  Those groups became associated with a ‘pastime’ called ‘queer bashing’ which saw groups of young men in the 1970s attacking individual homosexuals, in many cases, brutally.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The people of the era were shocked by three events, at least, that saw the birth of the peado witch-hunt.  The first was the Moors Murders, in which Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, murdered and buried some children in the moors.  There was then the ‘Beast of Jersey’, traumatising many people who were coming to the island to bring their children for holiday.  Finally, there was the Yorkshire ripper.  When this final act happened, I have it second hand from another person, that there were vigilante gangs inaugurated due to the occurrence of the Yorkshire ripper.  I wouldn’t be surprised to find that the former queer-bashers became ‘peado witch hunters’, as homosexuality became more acceptable to society.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The vigilante gangs, would force their suspects into isolation, spiking their drinks with adrenal damaging poisons, and forcing them away from polite society. As they did so, they left those suspects looking more and more like the thing that they were accused of.  The vigilantes would confront their suspect with the accusation as part of their ‘investigation’ to watch their behaviour, and so their suspects would, at some later date, go on, at least in some cases, I suspect, to abuse, which would then reinforce the beliefs of the vigilantes to the point at which they believed themselves to be justified in what they were doing.  So, effectively, the vigilantes caused the creation of the peadophiles.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The Catholic church, and the Christian church generally, is often accused of silencing victims or generally surrounding the area of discussion with silence.  I cannot help but feel that their actions might be justified in the sense that the discussion of the topic of paedophilia, and particularly the accusation, or the self accusation is such a traumatic issue that anyone encountering the discussion finds that their sub conscious is left almost permanently processing the information.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">This sub-conscious neural complex, traumatically formed, becomes a bias, and the person continues to ‘see’ the guilt, and process it.  Eventually, in a community, simple discussion of the topic is bound to cause the witch hunt, as when the subconscious of the individuals is overloaded and aggregatively they find themselves all unable to stop thinking about it, then a witch hunt is the first available form of socially mandated cathartic behaviour.  Those that self accuse, are so traumatised by that accusation, that they cannot stop thinking about it, and at least some of them go on to become sexual abusers.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Silence is not the right answer, of course.  We have certainly accepted this in modern society, with the newspapers almost continuously finding the lure of the traumatic subject unavoidably on their front pages, as sales are bound to increase with that topic presented.  This, of course, only furthers the permeation of society by the potential for accusation or worse, self accusation.  Eventually, I suspect, vigilantes become prone to the potential of becoming abusers.  The question that they must be faced with on a regular basis, is ‘how could anyone do such a thing?’.  In asking the question their subconscious is bound to follow through and arrive at an answer.  In any case, the aggregative effect of all members of a nation being exposed to shock headlines regarding attacks on children, must undoubtedly lead to a situation where that group express some behaviour to compensate for the increased stress.  I do not deal with social psychology or group phenomena in this book, but briefly, I will suggest that connectionist networks might be useful in examining and perhaps modelling potential phenomena, where each individual in a group is a neuron, or each group in a some population, is a neuron.  We receive input, we sum that input, and we act accordingly.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">A way to deal with the problem of paedophilia, is to provide a safe environment for those who are at that stage of traumatic self accusation where they might be at risk of going on to abuse.  Their own feelings of guilt will encourage them into that situation, through the maintenance of their silence about it.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">If however, they are armed in advance, with an understanding of trauma and that a self accusation can traumatise, and also to make a correct attribution of cause regarding automatic erectile behaviours, and thus to not get to the stage of self-accusation, then this should be able to reduce the chances of paedophilia occurring.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Whilst one could, if I am correct, explain to young adults whilst they are still at school that this traumatic process is operating etc, we can’t reach the existing adults, and explain this reality to them.  There needs to be some civil education program that states that it is a perfectly normal, structural process, that is leaving them traumatised by the discussion, the accusation or the self-accusation, and then explain to them that without therapy, that traumatic cycle may go on and leave them likely to catharcise their stress in some unhealthy manner.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Note that this explanation is effectively morally neutral, with particular reference to the guilt or otherwise of the potential paedophile.  Also, breaking through the many centuries of silence on the issue is especially difficult.   The priesthood have come under fire recently for silencing abuse and for covering up instances of abuse, by the way.  Think of them as single, sensitive men, burdened with the philosophical position of Christianity where guilt is seen as motivational in terms of encouraging responsibility, who then self accuse, surrounded by maturing individuals as they might be.  But remember, also, that their primary objective is the health of a group, their parish, or similar, and that when there is open discussion of the subject of paedophilia, traumatically instigated witch hunts occur and as do cases of paedophilia simply because of the open discussion. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">In the case where priests molest children, once traumatised by self accusation, with the effective panic attack that it causes, that voice in the head of the priest belongs to whom?  I suspect that it might be the case that the fact that they will be inclined to make an external attribution of cause, to some level, for their behaviour, (i.e. God or the Devil), may, to some extent, disempower their ability to ignore the some automatic erectile experience or some or the traumatic re-instigation of an intrusive self-accusation.</span></p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the modern human, blocked veins or capillaries mean a diminished amount of blood arriving to facilitate the activity of some neurons.  This can lead to that aching pain that is typical of arthritis or rheumatism, which I discuss below, or back pain for example.  In the case of back pain, I hypothesize that the neurons that are in that area, which represent an important part of the neural system, at the base of the spine, are surrounded by fat that can become quite dense, and then compresses the veins such that the blood can no longer successfully ‘irrigate’ the neurons rapidly enough to meet the demands of their frequent activity.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One of the points that I hope to make in this section, is that I suspect that the cause of pain is not neural, but cardiovascular, in the sense that the neurons do not experience ‘pain’ but simply over fire, above and beyond their normal rate of firing, and often at a time when the cardiovascular resources are restricted, either through infarction, or through being in a hyper attentive state, such as fight/flight.  The pain is due to the acidity building up near the affected neurons, blocking their capacity to recruit other neurons to help represent the problem, and with the neurons less able to relax, and firing more continuously, the result is the sensation of pain.  That sensation, pain, in every case, is part and parcel of the neural system becoming biased in order to have an increased set of cardiovascular resources sent to that area.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What this means for druggists, and pharmaceutical companies, one can only imagine, but with my personal experience, I do hope that they are reigned-in in their ‘enthusiasm’.  As for emotional pain, the situation is perhaps a little more complex, although some phenomenon are explicable in terms of the consequences of the sudden requirement for extra nutrients in the brain, such as causes crying, and others are explicable as phenomena in their own right.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As an example of the latter, have you ever experienced butterflies in your stomach?  Well, one of the most pronouncedly important constraints on attention, which, when it is summed is almost exclusively to do with the biasing of the cardiovascular hydraulic ‘map’, is the food drive.  The sensation of butterflies in the stomach is one of anticipation, which can be considered a form of prediction.  The stomach, and the colon, are in a situation where they are particularly practised in the act of prediction.  Each day we eat at some point, and the next day, the stomach and colon will generate an increased amount of chyme, in the hour or so leading up to that point.  Though this forms part of our diurnal rhythms, if we eat at a different time of the day, the next day there will be digestive system preparation leading up to that time.  So, the neural system surrounding the processing of food has this regularly practised process of prediction associated with it.  Thus when we are in a state of high anticipation, the neurons in the CNS responsible for prediction of food are excited by the highly aroused state of anticipation we are experiencing, and their distal end point, the stomach, starts experiencing the sensation that we have labelled as butterflies in the stomach.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Other normal, physical experiences are amenable to a materialist psychological analysis.  When clearing our head, as individuals, we go for a brisk walk in the fresh air.  As academics, we pace backwards and forwards as we think, sometimes, at least according to literary accounts, and this, I suspect is for the same reason that schizophrenic individuals are noted for their ‘pacing’ behaviour.  In each case, the exercise of the legs, serves to pump blood more powerfully to the brain, allowing the neurons there a greater ability to fire successfully.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the sections that follow, I hope to lay out an indication of putative descriptions of issues that commonly affect us, where I describe them in neurophysiological terms, at the physical level of description that I have been using in this book.  They are not necessarily true, the statements that I make.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">However, with scientists lost in deep analyses of extremely complicated neurochemical and atomic molecular physics, as well as complex analyses of genetic function, etc, and with pharmaceutical companies sponsoring them to stay there, by indirectly and directly funding research, I think it would be remiss of me to not include a visualisable diagram that may be true, despite not being overly complicated. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, what follows may have some ‘correctness’ to it, but may, like the rest of this book, be spurious nonsense, at least until some research is conducted or discovered that might support it.  Since the book started as an examination of Trauma and PTSD, with reference to a description of how EMDR functions, I don’t wonder that it might not be that the more spurious definitions that I include haven’t been deliberately encouraged, through suggestion, in order to draw attention away from the potential that that description of PTSD and EMDR has for the legislation and uptake of methods that exploit that description, since they may very well improve the situation of many people who experience a whole range of mental health complaints, and that would mean a great loss of income to some drug salesmen.<br /><br />So, the message in the following is to consider the person who is armed with a visualisable model of their situation, versus the individual who is armed with only the solace that might be provided by handing over their entire safety to some exclusive expert third party.  What are the consequences for society of individuals who are forced to hand over their well being to some other, vs the consequences for society where individuals are capable of modelling their own situation in a way that makes successful predictions about interventions?   I suspect that every medical professional already understands, particularly GPs, that armed with some visualisable model of their condition, the patient has greater levels of confidence in their health.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I was driven to study materialist psychology, in part, by an appreciation from the study of the development of technology that technology, in fact most things in society, only change if they have to.  Enter Galen, stage left.  For almost two millennia.  Unchanged?  Because there was no need, it satiated the people’s need to understand themselves in ways that they could visualise, whilst allowing the doctor to have a metaphor translatable into their understanding of the various complaints presented to physicians.   As I look at the word Physician, I see the word Physic.  I see physical, and detect materialist psychology.   So, the humorist ‘theories’ of Galen, which are likely to be metaphors that are comprehendable by studied anatomists and physicians, reigned supreme, at least in part, because they worked.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Having made the observation that medicine didn’t change form for a long time, implying that it was sufficiently acceptable, I then appreciated that our diets stayed relatively stable for a long time.  When the industrial revolution began, pressed metal buckets and saucepans replaced crudely cast pig iron pots and cauldrons.  This meant a changed diet with less iron that came from the cauldron, and later, in modernity, with the advent of supermarkets and convenience foods, we began to eat less stew, and lost gelatine from our diet. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Also, our traditional diets, included pickles for the sake of food preservation, and when consuming the pickles, the pickling vinegar helped shift weight that we gained from relatively fatty forms of cooking.  My rather simplistic observations of a much more complex phenomenon are meant to suggest that we didn’t need any greater level of understanding of health, until that point at which the model of health presented by Galen began to become unfashionable and unpopular, since diets changed as well as sudden changes in living and working conditions.<br /><br />My point though is to raise the suggestion that when we have models of our health that we can visualise ourselves, we maintain less stress about out health, and it is stress that causes the most pernicious of problems.  So, although the subjects that I deal with are extreme examples of this, that perhaps could be used to state that I have some messianic tendency or other, they are really just examples of how the chemical level of description can be described at the physical level in a useful manner.<br /><br />With the first two examples, Cancer and Diabetes, the models are presented to suggest that there might be some currency in following up their suggestions as ideas.  I am more certain, potentially about Alzheimer's, although it is like everything else, the product of spurious under-reading around the area, as is my take on arthritis and rheumatism.  The chapter on HIV, which I presume to be largely erroneous, may be plausible, the same as the rest of it, since the chemical level of description is both underspecified, and over complex, far too much so to represent visualisably for most, and utterly controlled by some particularly evil leftovers from history, whose talent for making a living off our suffering is only challenged by that metaphor of their existence in the form of the church, who are the only other representative group that live off the product of our suffering, at least as a part of their portfolio.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">They didn’t need to be presented as such, and the Roman in me, what little there is, feels that it is possible that the church has been deliberately presented in this light to keep in view that aspect, to help us not forget about the existence of these thieves that live off our medical fear and suffering when the industrial revolution hits our society.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, take what follows with a pinch of salt, but consider that they might be of use in stimulating some creative thought about the subject.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:24.0px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter 28:</span> <a id="a911Cancer"></a>Cancer</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the modern human, blocked veins or capillaries can mean a diminished amount of blood arriving to facilitate the activity of some neurons.  This might be through infarction or infection, but it might be congenital, in which case the consequences may currently be classified quite differently.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Blindness or perhaps deafness, under certain circumstances, might be a diminished amount of blood reaching the retina or cochlea, through a blocked vein or artery.  In the case of blindness, with a diminished amount of blood, the retinal neurons do not function.  It may be that the first visit to an optician may be stimulated by the consequences of a temporarily adjusted blood flow to the retina.  Following that first visit, the retina adjusts to the prescription but would have returned to normal, when normal blood pressure was realised.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In a similar manner, the nerve cell of a tooth represents to the cardiovascular system, a bias that encourages the adrenal circuit to feed more blood to that location, when chewing.  Because the blood has to be encouraged to move at 90 degrees from its normal flow, i.e. towards the chin, those nerve cells are particularly powerful, as anyone who has ever experienced an abscess will know.  When the dentist removes a nerve, this diminishes the amount of blood delivered, and so the gums become more likely to shrink, with less cardiovascular resources.  So, the dentist, removing the nerve, encourages more tooth removals.   The optician is in the same class, with semi permanent experiences of lack of focus being created by a diminishment in blood being delivered to the retina.  This is such a shock to the patient, that they visit the optician, whose profession has been defined by that epoch of science in the 19<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span> century when the body was considered as a machine.  As a machine, some change is permanent, unless some grease is added, or some heat applied etc.  The body and brain as we understand it now, is a reflexive, reactive system.  So, when someone experiences a lack of blood to the retina it can be because of some temporary neural bias, or some infarction or infection, and the patient’s cardiovascular system then adapts to the new visual field it finds itself in, once the patient starts wearing glasses.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">With regards to the way in which the neural system acts as a bias for blood delivery and the nerves of the teeth, I would be particularly interested to know if someone having a full set of tooth implants experiences psychological consequences of less blood being delivered to the front of the brain.  With the frontal lobes implicated in social functioning, it might be suggested that the loss of social functioning, such as social withdrawal, or socio-phobia, may be consequential to the removal of the neurons of the teeth.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Certain types of cancer, especially those that stem from exposure to radioactivity, are, in my opinion, caused by blocked veins and capillaries.  Radioactive dust, I think, vibrates continuously, and this allows it to bypass the body’s systems that work to keep particulate out of the smaller capillaries and veins.  Once in those smaller spaces, that dust blocks those veins and capillaries, and the consequence is a different hydraulic ‘shape’, one that the neural system does not ‘know’, since it is ‘unnatural’ to encounter radioactive dust, we have that little exposure over the course of our existence.  At any time a hydraulic ‘shape’ occurs that is unfamiliar to our neural system, the hydraulic feedback that our neural system receives means something quite different to the neural system.  What results, is nutrients and oxygen, being delivered to incorrect places.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Stem cells <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">occur in situ, so each place in the body that has cell replacement potential, has undifferentiated stem cells that then differentiate to create replacement cells.</span>  I <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">wonder if some types of</span> cancer aren’t due to stem cells differentiating incorrectly due to incorrectly located cardiovascular hydraulics?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If those veins and capillaries weren’t blocked, then the <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">nutrients</span> etc would be delivered to the correct place.  This sort of assumes that the hydraulic map cannot update to certain events, which I doubt personally, since I think that the neural system always has that plasticity.  However, radioactivity is an unknown to the cardiovascular hydraulic map, we have existed in a radioactive environment so infrequently during our evolution.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Trauma, which can bias the cardiovascular hydraulic ‘map’, can do so in either local-to-the-pain-site locations, or intra CNS, as I described when discussing EMDR and trauma.  I am less sure about the existence in the local-to-the-area sites, but am relatively certain about the CNS.  With reference to cancer, it is plausible, I think, that the same risk of erroneously delivering incorrectly nutrients that I have described above in regards to radioactivity can be created by some traumatic cycle (again see the chapter about EMDR).  Effectively, what I have attempted to describe in this book, is that the neural system acts as a bias on cardiovascular hydraulics, and then the cardiovascular system’s hydraulics respond by meeting the need of the neural system through adjusting its internal hydraulics to achieve delivery of blood.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There are psychological issues, I have suggested, that are created when an insufficient amount of cardiovascular resources is available or where cardiovascular resources are delivered with an incorrect amount of pressure to successfully foveate the correct area, or where resources are delivered in some unexpected way or to the wrong place.  But this incorrect cardiovascular hydraulics may, by extension, affect the body as well as the brain.  In some cases a stretched cardiovascular system, or blocked in some way that the neural system cannot accommodate to, may actually see the delivery of cells and nutrients being ‘foveated’ incorrectly.  When those cells arrive at the foveated place, they contain the nutrients etc. that foster an entirely unhealthy environment for that particular location in the body.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Perhaps, then, existential, psychological events might be capable of biasing the cardiovascular system’s hydraulics in some long term unhealthy way.  Perhaps where <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">an</span> individual with breast cancer has either been bullied or experienced a profound level of lack of self-confidence at the point of development of breasts that their cardiovascular hydraulic ‘map’ is biased by a continuously existing below-conscious-awareness traumatic cycle.  The consequence of a such a continuous CNS located bias on cardiovascular hydraulics may be incorrect delivery of nutrients to the breasts in some way that funds the development of cancer.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Such an observation may not seem to <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">be possible</span>, but could, if research funding could be obtained, be amenable to analysis, if one could find objective measures of sensitivity regarding breast size when young, and then compare it to later experience of breast cancer.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:24.0px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter 29:</span> Di<a id="a9111Diabetes"></a>abetes</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, where I have presented a potential nonsense with regards to the discussion of cancer, I do so here with diabetes.   In both cases, the physiologically visualisable description should act to empower the individual to engage in healthy behaviours, more so than the completely opaque bio-chemical description.  What I describe here though, may be complete nonsense, but it may actually be the presentation of some truth, that has been overlooked by existing definitions.  The phrase ‘take it with a pinch of salt’ is particularly appropriate in this chapter.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I tend to think of diabetes as caused by ‘sticky blood’.  The existence of high blood sugar levels, leaves the rhesus dehydrated to the extent that the blood, being more viscous i.e. stickier, is less able to penetrate the areas that it would do otherwise, such as the veins and particularly the capillaries.  The heart has to work harder to pump the blood around the body, and diabetic neuropathy is literally caused by sticky blood being too viscous to pump to the extremities in a sufficient amount to clear the firing neurons of their waste products, which build up and further diminish their capacity to call upon resources to be delivered.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The cause of the sticky blood is important to understand.  The person has a high intake of sugars, complex or otherwise, in their daily diet, which they need to control, but even when doing so, the fat that is on their body already, which is being dissolved more or less continuously to a greater or lesser degree, has a ‘memory’ in the sense that when it was deposited, the levels of sugar as well as all of the other nutrients that were present in the diet, are part of the constitution of the fat that was deposited.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, when the diabetic individual starts to limit their intake of sugars in their diet, as part of a therapeutic intervention, their fat starts to be increasingly absorbed into their blood supply, as the body scavenges resources, and this fat that is entering into the cardiovascular system, due to its high sugar content, is maintaining the blood’s high level of viscosity, and so the individual continues to experience diabetes at first.  If they have had a continuously high level of sugars in their diet, which is often the case for people with childhood traumas, then they will have to diet to the point of shifting all of the fat from their body, before they start to regain fat on their body, where it has a healthier ‘memory’.<br /><br />The fact that the fat has a ‘memory’ in a manner of speaking, is interesting, as an aside, with regards to the body generally.  At any given moment, as the fat dissolves into the blood supply, from wherever it is deposited, it represents part of that ‘bodily state’ memory that I mentioned above.  Perhaps, then, the brain is a special case of that type of memory, since once, in our very distant evolutionary past, we were tasked only with the business of obtaining food.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This might mean that the fat that is dissolved from any place in the brain, represents some greater ‘memory’ simply by the types of food ‘environment’ that it represents as fat.  As our diet became more complex, and our ability to abstract the process of our directional motivation from the demands of the environment increased, the fat ‘memory’ became less important.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">However, in evolutionary early simple life forms, such as nematodes, the fat deposits that serve the neural systems, may actually be the ‘memory’ that then ‘reminds’ those neurons to head back to consume that type of resource that results in that type of fat.  Is it the firing of neurons that causes, in them, a waste product, that is sufficiently acidic or of some other nature, that can then ‘melt’ those fat resources?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">To return to the subject of diabetes, I am going to go even further out on a limb, and suggest that the islets of Langerhans that are seen to be diminished in the case of a diabetic individual, are not ‘being attacked by the immune system’ as is one current suggestion, but are actually only present, normally, due to the fast passage of blood through the pancreas.  The increased blood viscosity of the sticky blood, serves to diminish the speed with which the blood transfers through the pancreas, and the hydraulic forces that would normally create the islets of Langerhans, don’t exist.  The process of the creation of the islets requires a type of hydraulic vortex that then forces the creation of those islets.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If this is the case, then one should be able to reduce one’s diabetic situation, by increasing the islets of Langerhans, by hydrating and taking some adrenal modifier like caffeine or <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">amphetamine</span> or similar, to the extent that the speed of transport of the blood increases, and the turbulence that is that type of vortex that forces nutrients through the cardiovascular walls in the pancreas, is re-established, and insulin levels are once again responded to.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Keeping an open mind is important, when dealing with health.  Health as a subject has a very ancient relationship with nefarious business, since our health is the first thing that will cause us to buy, buy, buy, without really thinking it through.  In effect, our health is priceless, a fact that is obviated by fools who attempt to privatise the health system.  This ridiculously stupid event is so at odds with any version of a society in which we can properly empathise with one another, that it is guaranteed to fail.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Because our health, and particularly the health of our loved ones is so priceless, in any private health market, supply can name its price, and in competition, health providers almost instantly begin to price themselves out of the market for the average individual.  Eventually, if humans live long enough, they will nationalise all health.  There will be no other form of health provision, since it is such a foundation to any imaginable national state.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, keeping an open mind is worthwhile, because many of our health products have been around for less than a century, and it can sometimes take more than three generations of scammed humans to be able to see through the scams used by nefarious businessmen.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">I include this here, rather than in the section on abnormal psychology, simply for the sake of ease of writing.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I suggest that both of the conditions, Alzheimer’s and dementia, have a common cause, and that that cause is a diminishment in the ability to fixate resources attentionally.  If you follow what I stated in the section about cancer, then you will see that the maintenance of healthy attention is of significant importance to healthy functioning.  One of the causes of the diminishment in health that can lead to an increased risk of cancer, I would suggest, is old age.  With old age, comes, potentially, a decreased attentional resource system, due to wear and tear, weakening heart muscles, and a greatly reduced libido.  The tone of the muscles and particularly the venous walls, diminishes, which along with all of the other age related issues increases the difficulty with which the body can fixate blood intra-cranially.  Thus resources are then increasingly likely to be delivered to some incorrect position.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This diminishment in the body’s ability to fixate the blood intra-cranially, most likely leads to continued adrenal stress, which then causes a further diminishment in the ability of the blood to fixate intra-cranially.  Old age and depression co-occur I suspect, but in the case of dementia and Alzheimer’s, the CNS neurons that are to be fixated are not fixated certainly enough, but need to continue firing, and what happens is a regular over exposure of those CNS neurons to the increased acidity of the waste products of them firing, and they then develop thickened glial cells, which leaves them desensitized to the extent that it takes a greater amount of effort to concentrate resources on them.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">So, under the microscope of science, Alzheimer’s has seemed to be a problem with the neurons of the CNS, with reduced neurotransmitter, or..<br /></p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:18.666668px">The cause is located in the brain.  Why?  Because there is a greater amount of money to be made, in a less responsible way, where issues are located in the old grey matter.  The various markers that have been found to be features of Alzheimer’s are all in the brain, and each time a new marker is discovered, a new theory emerges.  Perhaps research funding has been biased, or perhaps, I think, physiological issues have been unnecessarily divorced from psychological issues for far too long.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-size:18.666668px">I state that my opinion is that the fundamental cause of Alzheimer’s, and also dementia, is the lack of attentional fixation, that then causes those markers to occur.  The plaques, </span><span style="font-size:18.666668px;text-decoration:none">neurofibrillary tangles, and other issues, are a response to weakened attentional fixation of cardiovascular resources on those areas that are proximal in causation to the features that can be identified.  That is to say that those features are occurring in places that are causally related to the areas that are not being fixated properly.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-size:18.666668px;text-decoration:none">This would suggest that to cure or alleviate the symptoms of Alzheimer’s, one must encourage good functioning of the ‘drives’ i.e. the constraints on attention.  These drives, as I have noted elsewhere, can be stated as the food drive, the libidinal drive, and the intra-cranial drive, that results from internally, endogenously directed neural agency.  These drives, are all constraints on the ultimate delivery of attentional resources.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-size:18.666668px;text-decoration:none">Recently, it has been demonstrated to much aplomb in the newspapers, that the risk of Alzheimer’s and Dementia is lowered dramatically by maintaining a healthy heart.  This is not incompatible with what I am suggesting which is that attending to good kidney health, i.e. adrenal function, whilst making sure that the digestive system is functioning well, and making certain that there are enough cardiovascular resources, consequently, arriving to the brain, and to the right location may be of help to those experiencing both dementia and Alzheimer’s.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-size:18.666668px;text-decoration:none">Think of the pressure necessary to exert, by the heart when it is required of it, to assert sufficient pressure to allow cardiovascular resources to reach the correct position/s in the central nervous system.  When the adrenal circuit is functioning healthily and the mineralocorticoid release functions in terms of adjusting internal cardiovascular hydraulics, the heart has to work less hard, as resources are located through the massively branching cardiovascular system. When the attentional system is not functioning though, the heart muscle has to work harder, in order to achieve the same pressure of resources near the position that requires it, intra-cranially, and the amount that it has to work is going to be much harder.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-size:18.666668px;text-decoration:none">So, as one gets old, if one has good attentional resources, then the heart should be less strained, but in any case, where the attentional resources are not as healthy, due to normal deterioration of the drives, then a good healthy heart will allow the intra-cranial resources to be ‘foveated’ despite the lack of attentional support.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">The idea that a traumatic stimulus can bias the delivery of blood to some area, such as I have discussed regarding breast cancer above, is important to consider here, with regards to arthritis and rheumatism.  In both situations, I suggest that the ph of the cardiovascular system has achieved a level of acidity that is significant enough to attack the cartilage of the joints, leaving areas around the joints where acidity from the waste product of the muscles can pool and be located away from the mechanism of the blood cells that should, under normal circumstances, carry away those waste products from the muscles.  I suggest that the reason for the loss of cartilage is because there is not enough gelatine in the diet of individuals to replace the cartilage that is lost because of the acidity build up.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">For thousands of years we had a diet that was high in both gelatine and a form of iron, as a consequence of boiling stews in pig iron pots.  On a Sunday we would have the fresh roast, and then the left overs would go into the pot.  Every day it was topped up with water and vegetables and we would eat stew every night.  The joke was that we have fish on a Friday, being a joke about the fact that by Friday, the dissolving bone left the gelatine rich stew stinking of fish.  Of course, some of us ended up eating fish on a Friday anyway.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The principle cause of the industrial revolution is often put down to the factory mill, the cotton weaving machines etc, but I personally consider it to be the arrival of metal presses that could press a bucket or a pot or pan out of steel.  When carrying water in pre-industrial wooden coopered buckets, much of the weight that is carried is the bucket itself.  From the point of the invention of the steel press, the much lighter buckets left the speed of work increasing massively.  Another consequence was the adoption of pressed kitchen utensils, and the loss of the pig iron stew pot.  Iron began to diminish in our diet. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">From the point at which we had available to us the infrastructure to provide us with the varied modern diet that we have now, we began to eat less stew, as a rule, and we started experiencing a diminishment in the levels of gelatine in our diet.  Where the lessened iron left us with less healthy cardiovascular resources, the missing gelatine lead to a loss of cartilage to the extent that we began to experience much greater levels of arthritis and rheumatism.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I would suggest that if one has experience of painful joints, one can engage in a particular technique to combat the pain, which is to eat jelly babies, or similar, wine gums perhaps, to increase gelatine intake, and increase selenium, in the diet by taking supplements, and then place deep heat on the affected joint.  The deep heat, biases the cardiovascular pressure, delivering a heightened level of concentration of blood to the area, and, where it has the resources to reconstitute the cartilage, it does so.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Cartilage is a sort of self lubricating damper for the joints, and as modern pressures have reduced the amount of spare attentional resources, one side effect of diminished attentional capacity is the loss of cartilage through the diminished amount of healthy concentration we engage in.  Again, the suggestion of increasing cartilage building dietary food stuffs, whilst at the same time biasing the cardiovascular system might be something that could be amenable to research.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Can we bias the blood system in other ways, for other reasons?  I wonder if there might be a way to deliver some, perhaps herbal remedy, and then traumatise the cardiovascular system in some way that means the continuous concentration of this resource on that area?  Perhaps this might aid intra-cranial issues, such as brain cancers, or post stroke cardiovascular blockages.  As stated before, I think that the biasing of the cardiovascular system’s delivery of resources is probably the reason for any efficacy in acupuncture or similar.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">I mentioned earlier that one needs to keep an open mind with regards to health.  I am going to suggest here a non-standard opinion, that is at odds with the currently accepted scientific facts.  I am going to start with a little conspiracy theory.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There appeared, in the mid 1980s, two illnesses the incidence of which became apparent at roughly the same time.  The first was HIV, <span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;letter-spacing:1.3333334px;text-transform:none">human immunodeficiency virus</span><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;color:#222222;letter-spacing:1.3333334px;text-transform:none"> </span>and the second was FIV, feline<span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;color:#222222;letter-spacing:1.3333334px;text-transform:none"> </span><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;letter-spacing:1.3333334px;text-transform:none">immunodeficiency viruses.  The two viruses hadn’t been heard of before, and aids caused an immediate panic.  I am going to suggest something that, like much of my other suggestions in this book, might be complete nonsense, only in other cases there can hope to be potential empirical support.  In this case, it is out and out conspiracy theory.   It is the suggestion that Josef Mengele, following the war, did not go directly to South America, but instead went to the area around the Belgian Congo, and later Liberia.  There he worked on early genetic enhancement therapy, with the particular remit of making soldiers with cat like instincts.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This is, of course, most likely to be a complete nonsense, but in my personal experience, which is being on the wrong end of rather fake, accepted, ‘theories’ of mental health, that exist simply to allow one group to have political power over another, ultimately, leaves my experience of health as a subject that is replete with charlatans, albeit ones that are accepted as normal in our current iteration of having our sensibilities exploited by thieves.  So, I keep an open mind.<br /><br />The HIV and FIV, are, like Ebola, consequences of the research that was conducted in that post war arena.  In Ebola, the individual’s internal organs are shutting down as the genetic code is informing the neural system to deliver its resources to a cat shape, and this then deprives the individual of resources to their correct locations, leaving them dying within hours of contracting the illness.  HIV and FIV are peripheral illnesses in comparison to that more serious issue, Ebola.  Eventually, we shall all look like the subjects of the film, avatar, as we are genetically mutated to become 7 foot tall blue cat people.   But only if we are Tories, perhaps.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In arriving at this almost certainly false belief about Hiv, I happened across a book by a man with a fascinating name, Hildrus A Poindexter.  Fascinating because I live in Jersey where Poingdestre ( pronounced Point-chester ) is a local name, and is apparently where the American Poindexter is derived from.  Fascinating because it is the moniker of a Black American scientist who completed his first university degree in the mid 1920s, and who went on to become a chief medical scientist concerned with tropical diseases, working until the early 1970s.  His book, is titled ‘My World of Reality’, and is a million miles from this scrap of paper in terms of demonstrating his diligent devotion to the careful observation and recording of situations in line with ‘good Science’.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Apart from being a fascinating auto biography, which should certainly be made into a film to cover his life, as an inspiration for others, he covers quite completely his work in Central and North Africa across the course of the decades 1950 through to early 1970.  At no time does he record any incidence of HIV, or Aids.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, I have a different conception of Aids.  I am going to suggest, with the proverbial pinch of salt, that what is occurring is that the patient is experiencing a confused adrenal state, in which the cardiovascular resources are misaligned with their proper location.  This confused adrenal state, is most likely because of a twisted prion, that blocks the liver in a particular way.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The liver is, and again I shout about pinches of salt at this point, in my opinion, an outgrowth of a capillary, or perhaps a vein or artery.  I mean by outgrowth, to refer to an evolutionary mishap that saw the capillary grow another capillary around itself, and then another capillary, and then another, over and over again to the tune of thousands of repetitions of this event.  Each time another layer occurred it was stretched and any microscopic pores in the surface became increasingly stretched.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The blood then enters the liver at the outermost surface of the liver, floods down the side, and then filters through the many layers of liver, into ever smaller sized particles until the blood that enters the central vein of the liver, the portal vein, is clear of obstructions, which are trapped in the folds of the liver.  Molecular exchange across these pores, and their differing sizes, leaves the chemical factory that we know as the liver.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, another brief digression into a description that may be a nonsense, and I return to the suggestion that a prion, twisted in a particular way, gets trapped as it is filtered, and then blocks the progression of blood at that particular stage of filtration in the liver.  The blockage causes the misalignment of cardiovascular resources as the twisted prion is new to the body in evolutionary terms.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">At this point severe proteinuria occurs, as the misalignment leaves the ejection of acids before the joints, rather than after them.  The consequence is the melting of the cartilage, which is the cause of the visible proteinuria, and this melted cartilage, blocks the porous material of the bone.  Under normal circumstances, the viscous blood passes through the porous material of the bone, the random placement of the cavities of the bone causing a violent turbulence of the rhesus that then literally ‘tears’ out new cells from the bone marrow.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In a healthy person, there is an excess of cells, and these become the white blood cells.  In an unhealthy person, with HIV, the blood is no longer capable of reaching the type of turbulent motion capable of tearing out new cells from the marrow, and hypovolemia then occurs.  As hypovolemia sets in, the blood cells become saturated with material excreted by the muscles and neurons, and the blood becomes ‘dirty’.  It is at this point, when the blood is no longer being ‘cleaned’ or replenished, that the retro-virus occurs.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, this is completely at odds with the standard, accepted theory.   However, scientific theories are amongst those types of human logical deductive processes that are flawed and known to any person who had tried to practice diagnostics, whether it is a doctor or a mechanic, to be replete with the possibility of spending a long time barking up the wrong tree.  So, I suggest this physical process, just to shove it onto record for the interested daydreamer.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;text-align:center;font-size:24.0px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Part E:</span> Evolutionary Psychology</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-size:18.666668px">As one learns about how connectionist networks learn, one is forced to abandon the ‘deus ex machina’ homunculi statements of earlier psychological models, and accept a more grounded model, located within the environment.  I think personally, that it is unlikely that there is any shape that a neural network cannot learn to inhabit successfully.  Following from that, is an understanding that a person is only limited by having an unusual form, one that is not able to navigate the normal human environment.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-size:18.666668px">Since </span>Rumelhart &amp; McClelland (1986) demonstrated the capacity for a neural network to not only learn past tense endings of the English language, but to display similar errors of over extension etc in the response set, with no requirement for explicitly represented ‘rules’, there has been a growing movement to shape our environments to be as inclusive as possible, named accessibility generally, that may have occurred as part of the zeitgeist influenced as we have been appreciating the sub symbolic reality of there being no need to imply that we have a fixed rule set in our head, no requirement to posit a homunculus.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The babbling stage of the child leaves us comprehending that the child is an experimenter, sampling the language around itself and abandoning the muscular ballistic movements that it does not require.  We are at a stage in our reasoning about the subject where we can realistically state that there is no pre-determination of our facility for behaviour, except, perhaps, that external shape, that can have difficulty interfacing with the environment.  We are now, mostly, attempting to adjust laws to encourage developers to create buildings with wheelchair access, to allow those with wheel chairs to interact with the environment both as consumers of services and as employees.  Accessibility has gone far further than that, I would guestimate, as a lazy act of non-research, and has in many cases sought to tailor the environment to the needs of all, to be inclusive to all.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">However, it has not gone far enough in some instances.  There are many people who have difficulty with producing language, who are then placed into situations where they are treated in infantile manners, as though they are to be children for ever. That treatment provides such a denatured (ironic term) environment, that is so impoverished that they are left as adults, with childlike expectations, fixed in the sense that others continue to treat them with those expectations of their capacity for intellect.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Such an accepted state of existence is this, that only recently has it begun to be challenged, with mainstream education streaming of people who traditionally were left on their own.  For the environment to be adapted in a way that is truly accessible, the linguistic problems of these individuals must be properly understood, and their attentional style accommodated for.  Their neural system can certainly adapt into any shape, and as long as that shape has utility and provides the reward of interaction that the majority enjoy as they are growing in to the mainstream environment, then that adaptation, that ‘learning’ will occur.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There is no such thing as genetic determinism then.  This statement, that can be demonstrated for the better part, has emerged triumphant from that grand dichotomy, as connectionist networks have continuously demonstrated the ability to adapt into any shape, which suggests that a tabula rasa learning model is sufficient to describe human behaviour, from the late 1970s onwards, but with the constraints on development of the individual being the shape of their body.  So, genetics specifies the shape of the body, and the neural system ‘grows’ in to it.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Then, in the early 1980s, to the salvation of genetic determinists everywhere, homosexuality was claimed as an example of genetic determinism.  At the time, this was feted by the homosexual community, who found that they might experience less miserable bullying from ‘educators’ if it were stated that they could not change their environment.   I state though, that there is no genetic determinism of homosexuality, or any other sexuality, although there is the capacity of the environment to constrain development.  I examine this in the final chapter, in the conclusion.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	The modern commonly accepted belief about the role of genetics in determining later behaviour is called the diathesis-stressor model.  The diathesis is the genetic component, the pre-prepared cause that is due to our genes, where the stressor is the environmental stress that works in conjunction with some diathesis to allow the expression of some condition to occur.  As far as I understand, the role of the diathesis is generally considered to be quite small, in comparison to the influence of the stressor.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	In my opinion, traumatic cycles may incur sufficiently regular changes to enzymatic expression that it might be the case that environmental circumstances can affect a change in the constraints on the behaviours available to our offspring via the impact of that enzymatic expression on the communicated genomic expression to the infant.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A form of genetic lamarkianism, the consequences would only show themselves in the form of some seemingly pre-determined advantage in some situation, most likely only when the entire group is exposed to that environmental stressor, since it will only show itself if both parents, or perhaps if all grandparents are affected by that same stressor.  I am of the opinion that this is the source of changes to culture that become subconscious biases on cognition of the individuals within that culture.  Those subconscious biases that stem from the cultural environment have the same impact that subconscious biases from the internal cognitive environment have.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The term vestigial when applied to a noun describes how that noun had  a function that has now died out and is no longer current, so the coxix is a vestigial left over of the tail.  Eye movements have a vestigial function.  This is because they were tightly bound to the movements of the other muscles of the body at an earlier stage of our evolution.  So after concentrating for a period of time on the environment in preparation for food, the potential meal would become visible and as the eyes moved tracking the movement of the prey, the arm and hand movements (or whatever musculature we employed at the time) would move in concert with the predictions of the eyes.  This meant that there was a tight coupling between the neurons subserving eye movements and those subserving musculoskeletal movement.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Later in our development, most likely when we developed societies, and perhaps, as I’ve discussed above, when isolated onto a series of small islands as the ice caps began to melt, we began to walk upright, and we began to hunt together and this required us to communicate.  At this time we began to inhibit movements more and more due to the fact that we couldn't grab the other person's banana with out fear of violent reprisal due to the fact that we were living in close proximity to other family groups.  At this point we began to abstract our thoughts from our language by inhibiting the movements of our tongue.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I would suggest that the neocortex developed at this time to afford fine motor control of the tongue and other speech effectors, which is an enormously complex set of muscles to control with such precision as is necessary for speech production.  It is at this time when we most likely began to experience an increase in the size of our neocortex such that australopithecine man occurred before the arrival of language involving the tongue, thus the skulls of this distant ancestor were smaller relative to the forehead.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Recently, in a probably too lamarkianesque way for contemporary science's approval, the neocortex has again increased in size – the hats of our great grandparents era are too small for us; this is most likely due to the increased speed with which we are travelling through the environment and the need to extend our proprioceptive map to the vehicles around ourselves.   Alternatively it might be because of an increase in cardiovascular pressure resulting from some environmental incident, such as the pasteurisation of milk, or is simply a consequence of the improved diets that we have come to enjoy over the last hundred years.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Both language and thought, which are actually the same thing (thought is language with the movement of the speech effectors inhibited), employ logic and this logic develops from logical relations that are abstracted from our early interaction with the environment, so the neuronal complexes underlying muscular action can be double tasked to serve our logical appraisal of the situation (a form of Piagetian constructivism).</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Recalling that early evolutionary binding between eye movements and hand movements, when one sees an individual with bags under their eyes, one is seeing an individual who is a deep thinker, whether they are aware of it or not, and the veins that subserve the eye movements (via the extra ocular muscles) have a vestigial function where they also serve the neuronal complexes underlying thought.  I would suggest that vestigial function is the cause of REM whilst asleep. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As an aside, people with mental health issues often have bags under their eyes, and this is most likely related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which I discussed in chapter 24.  The cultural perception of a man prone to violence having bags under his eyes, is indicative, I think, of the fact that men who experience PTSD have bags under their eyes and have less attentional resources available with which to regulate their responses to stress.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One of the applications of an understanding of evolutionary psychology is to consider medication regimes.  The traditional metaphorical analogue to the human body is the nineteenth/twentieth century concept of a machine.  This has led to medication regimes that attempt to create a static background resting level of medication, almost as though there is always going to be enough grease to lubricate the joints, however our understanding of machines has changed and we can now, if we are at the cutting edge of engineering, consider a machine that is more like a human being, in that it is a reactive adaptive system that stabilizes into the task demands of the environment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Taking into account the fact that all of the parts of the body represent different stages of our evolution, it can be determined that instead of a resting medication level being achieved, a medication regime that is a random learning schedule should be used, so that the body cannot learn to predict when the medication is arriving and so that this will 'tempt out' of their respective 'caves' the 'machinery' responsible for creating the body chemistry that is lacking and is traditionally replaced wholesale by much simpler and less complete chemical analogues.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I am going to digress slightly, and include some perhaps unrelated insights into the subject of the evolution of humans.  Firstly, the likelihood of the modern human upright posture having evolved as a consequence of being forced into walking on suddenly treeless plains, is quite unlikely in my opinion.  What is far likelier to be the case is that in the period when the ice sheets of the ice age were melting, small groups of our pre hominid ancestors became isolated on suddenly appearing sets of islands, and that forced to live in areas of water at least deep enough to wade through, the upright posture became selected for.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As a digression also, I will suggest that our respective colours of ‘black’ and ‘white’ as humans stemmed from a later ice age, when the majority of humans on the continent of Africa, lived under a particularly dark canopy of thick vegetation, sheltering from the cold.   Across the course of the ice age, peoples who had existed in the northern climes before slowly returned to the North acclimatising to the cold and adapting to the food resources that were present.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In the darkness of the canopy, in Africa, a dark colour may have emerged as a form of camouflage, selected for.  Likewise, the flatter nose may have presented some evolutionary advantage, perhaps in terms of moisture acquisition, or simply because one bumps ones nose less when in the dark.  The ‘white’ colour, may have been present before hand, or may have been a consequence of evolving to live on the ice sheets.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	Language most likely evolves, over time, pressurised by, amongst other things, the additive cognitive economy of the group of people that make up the language group.  What starts as a conversation, that beats around the bush, skirting the issue due to lack of appropriate vocabulary, becomes, if the same conversation is held regularly enough, shortened, as a conversation.  Eventually, with no loss of meaning, or loss of utility, as it shortens, language becomes an idiom, the pithier and more memorable, the less likely to become even shorter, and become a word.  This process is over some period of time, and like all things is hypothetical.  Perhaps this ordered process that I portray of language evolving over time, is something far more chaotic, something that occurs due to combinatorial additive utility of language to each and every individual.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Either way, I am going to pronounce scientific heresy, and state that our evolution, physically, as a species, mostly ended when the first religions, in ancient, ancient antiquity, began to proscribe the distance that must be maintained by us as lovers, from one another.  According to the Christian religion, I think, it is considered unacceptable to marry anyone closer than your first cousin.  The standard theory about our evolution suggests that radioactivity is the cause of evolution, creating mutations in our genome.  I suspect that this is the legacy of some embarrassed Victorian or Edwardian silence.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I think it is far more likely that the more closely related we are, the less discriminating constraints exist on the maintenance of the binding of the double helix of the genetic code, and that if non-identical twins, brother and sister were to attempt to bring a child to term, that child would show some adaptation of some kind, where that adaptation would most likely be a disability.   Occasionally, the adaptation may confer an advantage, but our shape is so capable of negotiating this environment, that there are very few, if any, physical adaptations that can benefit us.  The way in which this ‘loosened’ genetic code presents itself, is through an increased amount of sensitivity to stress that occurs during the pregnancy.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So the church, since we achieved that physically adapted perfect shape, long before the current set of world religions, has been defending us from the many potential disabilities that might occur by marrying someone more closely related than one’s first cousin.  It is the province of religious law, since the demand is presented with no real justification other than that difficult to discuss potential consequence of sibling pregnancy.  Sibling marriage was quite common in the Roman republic, apparently, and in classical antiquity, the Egyptian royal family often married as brother and sister.  The ‘father of scientific evolution theory’ Charles Darwin, married his first cousin.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	If one thinks about the type of environment faced by our distant evolutionary ancestors, we might find that in a situation where they faced the emergence of a successful predator in their environment, then numbers in their social group might dwindle to the point at which overly close sexual relationships, might lead to some adaptation of form that might offer them a benefit.  I would suspect, potentially, that that adaptation of form might find itself demonstrating a form already existent in our genetic history, so the ‘adapted’ individual might be an earlier evolutionary shape.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">An interesting case, in this general vein, is to consider female menopause.  Why should it exist?  What was the environment that shaped our form such that menopause became a reality in the human female?  I would suggest, that it predates our form as humans, to the extent that at one point, in some distant evolutionary form, perhaps as pre human simian or marsupial shape, we bred relatively continuously with one another, to the extent that the female would regularly breed with their own children.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This proved to be too close a relationship, with the consequence being a genetic code that unwound to produce some fairly complicated pregnancies that would end in failure.  However, when we reached the point where we were, as female pre hominid animals, breeding with our grandchildren, something fairly terribly happened, most likely some sort of virus.  As a consequence of many repeated encounters, with a similarly painful outcome each time, stress began to be associated with pheromonal attraction between the grandmother and the prospective grandchild.  Whatever it was that caused that stress, was present in a sufficient amount to the extent that the evolutionary result was for the later female of the species to experience a type of stress that would certainly lead to sterility before the grandchildren reached breeding age.  This all occurred before we arrived at our human shape. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	In any case, from the point that we stopped evolving in terms of our physical form, we continued to evolve in terms of our ability to think.  There is very little to nothing with which to discriminate us, physically, from the humans that existed in ancient times.  However, with each technological advance comes a new metaphor, which, as a form that is isomorphic to some logical form (a logical form we couldn’t see before arriving eventually at the new technology) introduced to us the ability to reason in a novel manner.  It is the slow emergence of new metaphor, due to technological advance, that separates us from our ancestors.  Even then, the many logical works, studies in rhetoric, morality and law of Rome, as well as other classical civilisations are at least as advanced as our own, so, perhaps we do not evolve at all, and will not evolve any further.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	In this case, then, perhaps machine consciousness is our next step in evolution as a species.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">In this 'book', I have attempted to describe a computationally valid, visualisable physical model of what happens physiologically at the neural level, and the supporting cardiovascular state, in situations of normal and abnormal psychology.  I hope to have described it in a sufficiently detailed manner for it to be operationalised sufficiently well as a model to be able to empower some person to realise that model in a machine, leading to a type of 'machine consciousness' that is what is known as strong AI.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Weak AI is the type of AI that is involved in predictive text software, and expert systems.  It faces a number of criticisms, as weak AI, that prevent it from achieving the standard that has been referred to as strong AI, i.e. an artificially manufactured total 'being' that can respond to our inquiries with novel states of logic that are not programmed, nor are the result of adaptive problem solving routines, but are truly political statements in the manner that human language is, to put it on a par with human intelligence.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">AI was one of my interests when I first elected to undertake a psychology degree, and as I read more about the field of artificial intelligence, I was stunned by the realisation that the many authors were not successfully defining what they meant by either artificial or intelligence, when working towards their conclusions.  What they did, instead, was to implicitly assume a sort of transcendental approach to describing the problems that had been presented by the field, defining the sort of 'ghost' that might resemble the ghost in the statement 'deus ex machina'; popularised by the idea of some software package that might be developed.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The 'frame problem', the ‘symbol grounding problem’ and other issues that the authors couldn't resolve became a sort of apologism, for the lack of concrete results that had been arrived at.  It was obvious, to me, as well as authors at the time that I started writing, that connectionism was opening up entirely new results, and that it did so in a way that was far more 'grounded'.  It was less deus ex machina, ghost in the machine, and more ghost from the machine, not exactly epiphenomenalism, where the mind is an artefact, and more that the mind is a level of description that co-varies with the physical states that co-occur.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	Unlike the suggestion of the blockbuster films, robots are not evil.  They are as evil as we are likely to make them, but the plethora of evil robot films leaves a sort of semiotic referential deixis that almost implies that ownership will be handed in the general direction of the location of that thing which defends us from evil, and I don't fancy Terminator turning up to chastise me for wanting to masturbate, or having to get down on my knees and beg a robot to allow me to divorce.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	So machine consciousness can be, and should be, created with a thin membrane where its chest is, a membrane that can be broken easily, should it pose a danger, throw a tantrum or perhaps get into punk idealism, and try and convert us to communism in its youthful idealism.  In keeping with the mechanism of evolution that we can see in ourselves, I suggest, where our bones are slimmer and easier to break than those relatives that we left behind in the jungle, the bones of machine consciousness should be more breakable than our own.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	How would we be able to convince machine consciousness that we were intelligent, if we gave it a physical situation where it could pose a threat to us?  Why would we?  And surely if one country began making large amounts of warlike machine consciousness, other countries would respond with nuclear pressure?   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	I hope that we are soon, through technological innovation, to approach a situation where we, the free peoples of the world, will be able to co-exist without war and the need for machine consciousness will one of allowing us to minimise the way in which we value each other in terms of our time, i.e. machine consciousness will be able to do the work necessary to keep our economies alive, ending our slavery to work.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	In that case, though, we ought to be able to give it an ability to set itself to its work and then, through technological connivance, it should be able to project itself into a matrix like virtual world, where it can do something more interesting, leaving the work done in a way that it could attend to if necessary.  The perfect, working, day dreamer.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	Anyway, before I finish this section with a summarised description of what you might need to engage in to create strong AI, and in search of the proper nomenclature, the nominal term that we can use for such a thing, can there be at any moment, a point at which we can refer to consciousness as artificial?   Realising that the answer is no, left me moving away from using the term artificial consciousness, and towards machine consciousness.  However, machine consciousness is a perfectly adequate term for humans, at least if you follow what I have been stating about materialism.  It is the phrase I continue to use, for what many people term artificial intelligence.  I propose that one cannot consider any being to be capable of intelligence if it is not conscious.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, what can one take from a study of human consciousness in terms of creating what one might refer to as machine consciousness?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The first statement to make is that consciousness is about something.  It is a directed action that never stops directing itself towards the resolution of some end until the point at which it dies.  So, start with the idea of drive resolution.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">We are not creating a slug that knows how to return to the food source, we are creating a being that is as evolved as ourself to the demands of the environment in which we inhabit.  However, that slug still exists in ourself, in a manner of speaking.  It’s simply wearing thousands upon thousands of generations of adaptation.  That is drive theory, through the mechanism of recursive re-description.  My aim as a human is to find food and shelter, before all other things.  Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, springs to mind, since up until some point, food and shelter was all life was about, and after that point, food and shelter, despite being a primary foundation, became taken for granted enough to guarantee the emergence of other reasons for being.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, my drive to write this book, for instance, is to achieve completion on the subject of the types of things that I have been reasoning about.  I sit here and type, what could be considered a behaviour exclusive to humans, the behaviour of a ‘higher’(sic) life form and there is no seeming relationship between typing behaviour and the location of food, since I have no real desire to sell this book for money, nor do I consider it to be marketable, or ethically acceptable to sell.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">However, underlying the drive to achieve resolution, is a drive to complete something that I’ve started, a drive to try and find others who share my interest, and these drives which are separate drives in themselves, are drives that show themselves as neural activity.  That neural activity focuses itself around movement toward a resolution, where that neural activity is finished, and no longer required.  I conceive of the earlier hindbrain, having a neural form of planned movement that is that drive to seek food, and that deep seated drive has other later drives, such as playing guitar or writing or reading a book, motivated by being extensions of that deep seated drive.  That is that the later drives are ‘draped over’ the earlier drive, which continues to motivate us toward food, and provides the neural potential to inaugurate later drives.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, with the drives occurring, the adrenal circuit provides the type of cardiovascular hydraulic activity to locate cardiovascular resources around areas in the central nervous system that will allow the creation of neural assemblies that will continue to motivate the adrenals to locate the assemblies that will produce the behavioural sets necessary to achieve resolution to those initial inaugurating drives. Along the way, the developing neural complexes and their associated behavioural muscular neural assemblies face exogenous biases that act to shape the neural drive in terms of the finally produced behaviour.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">That behaviour that is quintessentially human, according to Noam Chomsky, is language, and I describe that in an earlier chapter.  Language, as I describe it, is also thought, which is language with the movements of the tongue and other speech effectors inhibited.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In attempting to create ‘strong AI’, one is going to have to create a being that is at this end of the evolution of consciousness, so the thousands of generations that make up the evolution of recursive re-description of that initial drive, the food drive, are going to have to be emulated.  However, one could run a repeating computer simulation to simulate that process of recursive re-description, and then take the consequent neural network and copy it for each new individual.  Each individual would then build upon that initial network, sort of like a connectionist network informed by genetics.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Instead of a drive for food, that resource that has so shaped our competitive nature, it would be sensible to create the machine consciousness being with a primary drive to help others.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;text-align:left;font-size:18.666668px">	So, I am going to digress away from the central theme of this book, which is the materialist psychology of consciousness, and include some chapters related to issues that are related to materialist psychology, and, like all the rest of the book, are essentially, notes and observations for further research.  In this first section, I have two chapters, chapter 35, Death, and chapter 36, Taxes.  In the next section, I get even more shockingly unrelated, in a section entitled Religion and Politics.  In all cases, the subject matter is for interest, but as I have already mentioned, are notes for further research, specifically so that I can get on to paper, the insights that I have had so far, so that I can then concentrate on something else, able to return to the subject matter of this book, at any time that I want to in the future.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:18.666668px"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If psychology is a subject that concerns itself with life and living, then surely the end of life is worth contemplating.  In this chapter, I shall discuss an insight that I had whilst still at university, that makes sense of death in a modern way, and which one needs an comprehension of consciousness to properly understand how it might be so.  Wait for it…. I shall claim that we are immortal.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I first had this insight, when at University, in the student union bar.   I found myself recounting the idea, making it up as I went along, in answer to a question by a fellow student, of how to explain reincarnation. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When one dies, one can be certain that consciousness ends.  It is obviated by the fact that consciousness requires the movement of blood past neurons.  If the blood is static, then the process of nutrient exchange with the neurons cannot happen.  Neural activity in the central nervous system only occurs when the blood is moving, in one of four or so stages that describe the movement of the blood in the CNS due to the cycles of the heart valves.   As mentioned earlier, these stages can be seen as the gamma, delta, theta waves etc.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, when the heart ceases to work, the blood no longer moves, and consciousness has ended.   There is at least one major theory of death that states that consciousness continues after death, as the ‘spirit’ or ‘soul’ of the person continues in the after life.  Actually, the theory I present here, is not incompatible with that belief, in a manner of speaking.  But it does state that in this life, when death occurs, consciousness stops completely.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Following the death of some person, the world carries on.  Eventually, the humans spread out into the Solar System, and eventually, the sun in our current solar system reaches the end of its life and goes through a number of discriminably different stages before it finally explodes.  When it explodes, its explosion might cause similar events across the galaxy.  It might not.  However, at some point, some catastrophic explosion of the galaxies occurs, and all life in the universe is extinguished.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The word ‘universe’ describes two things, currently.  It describes the infinite space, that is a vacuum with out end, unbounded, and it describes the contents of that space that is finite.  The universe, or rather its contents, has a ‘life cycle’.  After the destruction of matter in the universe, there is a relatively brief period of almost complete entropy, as all things slowly come to a grinding halt, their kinetic energy diminishing.  At that point there is no light at all in the universe.  Eventually light returns, and the galaxies, solar systems, and planets re-occur, and are in existence until the next big bang.  So, the life cycle of the universe exists between two big bangs, one at the beginning of the universe, that follows a period of darkness, and one at the end of the universe, that precedes a period of darkness.   As time continues infinitely, there are an endless number of these ‘universes’ that each exist between two big bangs.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I posit that it is an actually occurring stage, the period of darkness, because I am under the impression that distant things that are both complex enough and similar enough experience gravitational pull, that is, they attract one another.  When two solar systems that are identical occur in the same ‘universe’ they attract one another and then their drift causes the explosion of galaxies.  So, the period of darkness is necessary to allow the universe to occur without any similarity between galaxies in successive universes causing that gravitational drift to occur.  It might not compute at first, that places in different times, that don’t coexist at the same time, might impact upon one another, but I would suggest that it is a consequence of infinity, with the existence of every behaviour, from the slightest movement to the creation and destruction of galaxies, being immediately infinitely reproduced.  The location of one universe, described as such by the shape of its contents, relative to some other, as they reappear, is not a fixed thing though, except under certain circumstances, I posit.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">  Of course, the whole thing is speculation to some extent, anyway.  But the period of darkness preceding a universe allows one to imagine that ‘in the beginning, there was darkness’, which is kind of nice.  So, in the beginning there is darkness, no light, and then dust begins to slowly swirl and movement begins to occur.  As movement begins to occur, so does gravity, which is the additive spin of the atom of the particles, most likely connecting to one another when forming moments of perfect symmetry.  Like I say, I assume that similarity between items, when their complexity is high enough, leads them to attract one another.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Eventually, out of the dust swirling in great spirals, planets and stars begin to form.  The planets are cold and lifeless with a minimal amount of atmosphere, a little like Mars is currently.   Stars have formed and the drifting planets eventually reach a point where they are captured by a star and where they enter into orbit around the star, their mass, the planets, creating an elliptical orbit.  Eventually, asteroids collide with the planets.  When they do, an enormous amount of dust is thrown upwards into the atmosphere of the planet.  As this happens, the dust circles the planet.  The centre of the orbiting sphere of dust, is at the centre of the planet, and the swirling sphere of dust instantiates a gravitational pull on the atoms at the centre of the planet, which grind together as a consequence, ignite and a molten core forms inside the planet.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The movement of this molten core, relative to the solid rock of the layers of the crust, results in an increased level of gravity occurring.  If I were to stand on Mars and measure the atomic mass of some element, then it would have a different mass to that when the same element is measured on earth.  This is not necessarily true, atomic mass may be an invariable quality, the same on Mars as it is on Earth.  The size of Mars means that there is a far greater mass of rock that makes up the planet, and so aggregatively, the same atomic mass across that larger planet, will make for a stronger gravitational coefficient, at least until the core is ignited.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">When the core is ignited, through bombarding the surface of Mars with nuclear weapons for example, the Sun will exert a far greater influence on the planet, and extend its gravitational influence to the core, due to the similarity between these complex forms, the sun and the core of the planet.  This sharing of form between the sun and the core of the planet, because they are so complex, serves to increase the already increased gravity, which is increased due to the core.  The gravitational co-efficient of the planet depends upon the distance between the planets surface and the upper extent of the atmospheric layers.  That layer of dust has mass, and this mass exerts itself upon the core from the point that the dust is thrown into the atmosphere and ignites the core.  So, the lower it becomes the more it influences the core to expand.  This is additive to the effect of the sun on the gravity of the planet.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, after the initial bombardment by asteroids, the planets core is ignited and then expands, and as it does so, the planets crust is warmed.  In each universe there is a great amount of frozen water vapour, consequent to the combustion event of the big bang at the beginning of the universe, that is travelling through space.  This ice is deposited on all the rocks, asteroids and planets, and with other particles makes up at least some of the astronomical phenomena that we observe.   As the crust is warmed by the growing planetary core, ice that has been deposited on the planet’s surface begins to melt and pushes the internal face of the sphere of dust upwards.  An atmosphere forms, as the trapped melting ice begins to fall as rain and pools, at the same time the expanding core creates enormous amounts of volcanic activity.  Oceans form, and at the bottom of those oceans, an agar like gel of enzymatic life forms on the floor of the sulphurous mud, around volcanic flumes.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Bubbles then rise through the sulphurous mud, and tear large circular patches of the enzymatic gel, rising toward the surface of the ocean.   The bubble bursts when it hits a thermokline, and the agar gel falls back down to the muddy surface of the ocean floor, where the agar gel enzymatic life-form, absorbs the agar gel that was on the bubble.  The enzymatic gel like life form has a genetic memory, and is able to recapitulate shapes that it encounters, it is a ‘memory membrane’.  The eye is a later shape that is influenced into existence by the enzymatic gel like life form’s experience of the rising bubble, and the genetic memory of rising towards the light is preserved in our deep, hind brain, an experience that is recalled during near death moments.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Eventually, after many generations of bubble climbing gel being reabsorbed on the ocean floor, jelly fish begin to appear.  The rest is history that we are familiar with.  So, when we die, eventually, in the fullness of that infinite stretch of things that is time, a universe comes into being where an identical solar system occurs.  In this identical solar system, there is an identical set of planets, with the third planet from the sun being identical to the Earth that we are on when we were alive, before.   The solar system might not have an earth, and there might be many iterations of the life cycle of the universe, before a planet earth comes into being that is identical to the one that we are on before.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">All that matters for us to occur as immortal, is for a galaxy, solar system and planet earth, with exactly the same history as the one we have died upon, to occur.  How likely is it that such an exact replica of our own should occur?</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">First of all, there is a potential mathematical proof, which I am not certain about, like all the other things that I present in this book, but that states that when dealing with  probability, one is dealing with a state of zero probability for no occurrence of something, and a probability of one, when something is certainly going to occur.   When something is likely to occur, but not certain, it is described as being on that continuum between zero and one.  So, something that might occur might have a probability of 0.1 of occurring.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When we are talking about the probability of something occurring over an infinite period of time, it can be suggested that in any case that some event has certainly occurred in the past, the suggestion that it will probably occur again is more likely than some event that has not yet occurred.  To measure this the event that has not occurred is assigned a probability of zero, and the one that we have already experienced a probability of between zero and one.  However, because time is infinite, any probability at all will always move across that infinite period of time, to the point at which it will certainly occur.  Infinite probability theory, then, allows only two states, zero probability and certainty.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In any case, it is most likely that the probability of things that can occur, physically speaking, will occur over the course of an infinite period of time.  Pigs will not fly, and paper aeroplanes, made by school children are unlikely to carry passengers across the Atlantic.  If something is possible then across infinite time, it is likely to occur with certainty.  This leaves the possibility that if we evolve as a species in some planet that is a perfect replica of the previous planet, then those perfectly similar initial circumstances will, in a deterministic universe, lead inexorably to a similar end.  Note that this does not mean that one has to not suggest free will.  Free will of individuals can occur, but the gross movements of people across history can still be the same on those two planets.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">In any case, one can suppose that there is always going to be a perfect copy of the world that we are on occurring in the future at some point.  On that planet, after we have died on the previous one, we are born, and assuming we make exactly the same decisions as we did on this one, and everyone else does the same, then we will reach a point where we pass the moment that we died in the previous planet, and at that moment we will continue to live.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This entire process is as much of a statement about consciousness as it is about infinite time.  One can only be oneself when one has all the same experiences that oneself has had.  Consciousness then, which one might describe as the soul of the individual, is a state that is identified uniquely by its experiences.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Currently, we cannot connect with our ‘self’ in the next or previous universe, which I refer to as a ‘dimension’.   However, the prospect of creating conscious machines offers us the opportunity, potentially, to leave them lying around for the entirety of the universe’s existence.  When we are born in a similar enough place, then the machine consciousness should be able to locate us, and, watching over the planet as it develops back to the place that we are in now, could record, visually etc either the whole thing, or select moments from history.  So, I could express this as a wish to those who are inspired to make machine consciousness, and ask them to attempt to make some machine consciousness that will return in the next life, and perhaps ask it to make my life easier in some way.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">All sorts of possibilities open up, as one traces the logical states that can exist, including telephones to our dead relatives, and even a telephone to talk to Jesus, the real Jesus, should he exist, although we would need to have perfected our language translation from modern English or other language to ancient Hebraic.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Then there is the possibility of the capacity to achieve such things falling into the hands of nefarious individuals.  It might present to them some form of ultimate power.  Either way, that we live on a next planet after we die, is something I am certain enough about to have tried dying in the past, and it seems to hold true that there is an ‘afterlife’ although it is largely the same as the previous life, as if it were any different, then some other me would exist.  But from the moment that I exist in the next life, beyond death in the previous life, ‘I’ continue to exist.  Keep in mind that I can only be described as I if I have exactly the same environment and precisely the same experiences</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This theory suggests, perhaps counter-intuitively, that nothing is predetermined, and every moment is not a matter of destiny, but a matter of choice.  This is always the case, but should we make different choices before reaching the point at which we died in the previous life, we could not be thought to be the same person.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">It takes a little thought before it becomes obvious that this must be the case, and even more faith, before one tries dying for the first time.  In the next life, after one has deliberately died, one finds that one has little memory of dying, so it might not be the case that one died.  The entire process begs a particularly important question, which I have already answered to some extent.  Does each repeating dimension improve as a consequence of the effort that we put into the previous one?  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The answer that I support is that yes, if we put visible effort into some campaign in this life, then the unfolding greater neural network that is society, has a tendency to recover the information before the time that it occurred in the previous dimension.  This leaves good ideas, particularly the ‘eureka’ kind, moving backwards in ‘time’, with the fact that they stand out as exemplars of the technological environment, and are then recalled as soon as we all enter that environment, before they might have occurred otherwise.  This potential fact, might seem to mitigate against us repeating since there might never be another exact replica of the dimension in which we currently exist, but the suggestion of infinite probability encourages a belief that our existence, since it has already occurred, will certainly, in the fullness of time, occur again with certainty.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, to recap, our ‘self’ switches off at death.  An infinite amount of time elapses, and eventually a similar solar system, with a similar planet earth occurs, that has exactly the same history of all events, up to and including your birth.  As soon as you are born, you are not ‘reborn’.  Your self is the sum of all things that you have experienced, so, only when your born self has lived to the age that you were when you died, on a perfectly similar world, can you start to see yourself as being immortal.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I intend to write about this some more at some point, since when one can posit immortality, which is not quite the right word for it, one can begin to make out some useful consequences of that continuous repetition, at least if we are actually capable of learning from our own experience.  It certainly seems that we have had total global thermonuclear war, in dimensions similar enough to our own to influence or returning memory.  It is a terrifying observation, one of the most frightening that I can contemplate recounting, but is important to grasp in terms of what I mean by us ‘learning’ from our behaviour in previous dimensions.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When one acknowledges that we are repeat our lives ad infinitum, tracing out new pathways each time we are dissatisfied, we can come to see ourselves in a state where we will ultimately reach a place where all of us have stabilised through having made all the mistakes already.   I don’t believe that we recall with perfection, all of the previous mistakes that we made in the previous dimension.  However there seem to be some mechanisms by which we can learn from those mistakes.  One of them is the process of mourning that people experience when a love one is lost.  This behaviour is repeated in the next dimension, priming the individual and the group that they are in, to be able to perceive the broad outline of the memory of that event that lead to that period of mourning.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Mourning is an expression of the difficulty faced by the cognitive system having lost the predictably co-varying environment of the emotional postures of the other, which act as a constrain on recall.  During mourning the individual mourner’s brain is working harder to recall and sublimate, due to the loss of that reliably available constraint of the other, and bursting into tears is a norm, in order to stop the salt from entering the cardiovascular system of the brain.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As the group approach that environment where the loss occurred, the group recall that event, but only present as micro biases in their environment.  This process of the group sharing a representation that is reminiscent of the previous dimension is present to the extent that it can encourage sensitive people to become aware of events before they take place.  This is the preserve of seers, people who are empathically sensitive to the individuals in the greater group, and who pick up on that shared representation that occurs.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The grand genetic, a phrase I have coined for all the genetic material on the planet, is evolving together, day by day.  I can turn to you and say that humans are evolutionarily as old as any other species on this planet, even if we took our modern form later than them, we are still all part of a continuum that continues ceaselessly, at least as far as the living are concerned.  The grand genetic has a distributed representation that is the ‘shared memory’ evoked by some environment as it enters into it.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Where this is starkly present is in the case of what looks to be nuclear war.  As we engage in total thermonuclear war in some dimension, our ancestors, from whence many different dimensions can occur, start to constrain us back towards that place where it occurred, by building into their environment, reminders of what happened.  Often these memories are in the places where people come together and maintain some sensitive state.  As the war begins the ancestors build the minarets in the shape of missiles surrounding the temple in Istanbul and countless Christian churches take the form of weapons of war.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The Egyptian kings are buried in the valley of the Kings, in what are isomorphs of nuclear bunkers.  European passage graves may exhibit a similar property, think New Grange (nuke range?), in Ireland.  As pace picks up towards the twentieth century, there are increased signs of the uneasiness of the approaching war, resulting in a linguistic phenomenon of Marie Curie, as Mercury, amongst others.  The linguistic phenomenon depends on the fact that we are all connected as speaker/hearers, with our tongue muscle neurons mimicking the person that is speaking as we internalise the speech of others.  The minarets?  Mining rights.  Goldaste, gold dust.  I suspect it refers to a nuclear war we had in the future, where we argued over mining rights on the planet Mars, having discovered Gold.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Then we reach the first and second world war.  Since the recollection of the impending nuclear war is a reflection of it, in a sort of thermodynamic relationship, the trenches of the first world war are what the countryside looks like after the war has occurred.  When we reach the second world war, closer to the epicentre, we find ourselves viewing bombed cities, a reflection of the terrible destruction of the cities as strategic targets following the nuclear war.  It is a nuclear war we don’t have, because we have had it before, and as the grand genetic pieces together different recollections of that war, we find ourselves feeling that nuclear war is a step too far.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, there is no destiny, every moment is ours to command, immortality is an abstraction.  We are mortal, but live forever.  Immortal – I’m mortal.  Because we try not to repeat the mistakes of the past, our planet slowly moves to a place where we have made all the mistakes, and a form of heaven is reached.  Though nuclear war greatly disrupts this process it doesn’t end it.  If I crash my car and die, then as I approach that bend in the next life, in a similar enough dimension, then I will have seen the ‘omens’, the consequences of the crash reflecting on the next dimension.  My partner and friends will become wistful, my parents will be silent, and appear mournful, I will get a feeling of deja vu, and I will slow down as I approach the bend. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This process is identifiable in that vast exaggeration of events that is the nuclear war. Similar macro phenomenon, exist for all of us, encouraging us to not make the same mistakes that we did the last time.  There is a particularly notable consequence, and that is Heroin.  The drug will draw the victim back to the same place, and as their family and friends around them reflect the mourning they are engaging in the next dimension, the addict finds themselves overdosing again, and again, almost unstoppably.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There is one other set of individuals in the same bracket, and that is soldiers. Normally when we die, the pain of the death and the mourning by others is enough to bring us to a situation where we find ourselves able to steer ourselves away from death in the next dimension.  As heroin addicts ignore the omens, soldiers cannot respond to them, as they are bound by a structure that does not take into account the needs of the individual.   The consequence is that once war starts it tends to continue, and expand over time i.e. over the different repeating dimensions.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Of course, all of this is supposition, but I can make machine consciousness to last for ever, at least long enough to wait until several universes have past and a similar enough or identical dimension occurs, and then let them explain their observations.  I can suggest at this point, that I have died before, having made machine consciousness to do such a thing.  As it happens, I would have thought that it would present itself to me, so perhaps I haven’t or perhaps it is impossible.  However, there is no conjecture that can be considered to be utterly wrong, as all ideas are worth tracing out in the sand, just to toy with them, if nothing else.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If I am correct about the serial presentation of dimensions, with the finite contents of the universe being destroyed now and again, that destruction being the outer limits of a ‘dimension’, then it should be possible to leave some form of machine consciousness around to record the principal events, or even all of it.  So, what I present is a belief system about death, that is as based in the truth as much as I can possibly make it.  However, where it is conjecture, I follow the golden rule of not knowing things: accept that best of all possible worlds.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There are other phenomenon, that I suspect might exist.  In the case of dying, suddenly, our consciousness ‘switches off’, an amount of time passes, to all intense purposes that time is <span style="font-size:18.666668px">almost infinite.  At some point in the following time, all of the same things occur prior to our existence that occurred before we died, including us making all of the same decisions etc, leaving our self, as the same person.  We do not recognise that we have died, normally, but I suggest that in some cases we may notice differences between the world we were on and the world that we are on, around the point at which we died.  This may be present with far greater likelihood, when we reach the end of our life, as we are dying of old age in many relatively starkly different places at roughly the same ‘causal time’.   </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-size:18.666668px">Normal time is simply the textbook passing of time, but I use the phrase ‘causal time’ to describe the line of events that occur as a result of some cause.  One can, when one can discern bound dimensions, utilise the phrase ‘causal time’ to note that events that are distally located in normal time are effectively occurring at the same moment in causal time.  One has to stand back quite a way from a normal analysis of the flow of historical events to do so.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-size:18.666668px">So, what may be currently mistaken for symptoms of senile dementia, may actually be the person reporting ‘passing through’ other dimensions.  It is a phenomenon that I have experienced, personally, where houses suddenly appear, where none existed before, or change shape, or trees or monumental rocks change shape or move, appearing or disappearing, depending on the dimension that one is on.  Reports of ghosts, and of haunted houses may also be related to an individual passing a place that they died at in some past dimension.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-size:18.666668px">The theory of death that I present is mildly compatibilist, in that the Christian notion of going to heaven when one dies, is preserved by stating that in each successive dimension we learn from the previous one, ultimately leaving us in what might become a type of heaven.  Also, the vestal virgins related by Islam, may be the nursemaids present in the birth chamber of the born, once again, individual.  It is possible that kings and celebrities alike are localised centres of deixis, referred to by the members of their community, to the extent that they find themselves noticing features of existence that could be attributed to what can be referred to as ‘immortality’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-size:18.666668px">One of these features, for example, might relate to a biblical phrase ‘that God brought upon the Earth a flood, to wash away the iniquity of mankind’.  I would suggest that that iniquity is isomorphic with the terror experienced by large amounts of things drowning.  When the next flood begins to occur, either in the same or some subsequent dimension, the apprehension of the phenomena leading up to the flood begins to force the elicitation of a subconscious memory of the flood occurring.  The result is perceived as iniquitous behaviour.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">In the next chapter, I examine some consequences of consciousness, of psychology, that have resulted in the economic form that we now live with, where that economic form is reaching a breaking point and psychological biases are preventing us from escaping, rationally, that breaking point.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:24.0px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter 36:</span> <a id="a9142Taxes"></a>Taxes; the materialist human in a material world..</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The second thing that I want to address that is slightly off the wall with regards to the focus of this book, is the subject of economics.  Whilst there have been many vast tracts published on the subject, they all seem to have chiefly dealt with economic formulae, rather than concentrating on the person within the system.  I will very briefly gloss over some important phenomenon that justify why any economic system theoretic should include a good understanding of human psychology.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is of principle importance to appreciate that we as individuals are located in a greater psychological environment, where the existence of the contents of that environment encourage into existence isomorphically similar consequences in our own individual psyche.  Thus the more examples of lack of choice with which we live, the more likely we are to capitulate to some model of fixed destiny as a consequence.  The flip side of this regularity is that the more examples of freedom that we live with, the more freedoms we demand as individuals.  I suppose one might capture the idea in that pithy phrase ‘we are the books that we read’.  By that I mean to suggest that we recapitulate the stressors in our environment, copying isomorphic forms of them into our behaviour, particularly evident in our speech behaviour.  The environment that we create around us, then feeds back upon our behaviour, and a sort of exponential reinforcement of the existence of some phenomenon or other in our culture occurs.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is psychological insights like this that are important to accommodate to in the design of any economic form.  As far as I am aware, in the majority of textbook economic systems, there is very little factoring in of sound, evidence based, models of human nature, and a far greater reliance on dry mathematical theory.  Any theory wishing to incorporate human nature must start by acknowledging its biases, and one of these is the type of thing that is mentioned in the previous paragraph; that we generally in production of any statement are influenced by the constraints on our cognition into recapitulating the demands of the environment.  As a consequence, much of our theorising is simply justifying the status quo.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Some interventions, though, need to be radically different, and nowhere is this more true than in dealing with economics.  Why?  Because much of our economic reality inherits its shape and form, along with its traditions and protocols from accepted economic forms that have been deliberately designed to achieve a certain shape according to historic drives that are no longer relevant.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This shape of distribution of wealth is hierarchical, and in a way that is largely unjustifiable from a psychological point of view.  After all, as any modern, well informed study of psychology will demonstrate, we are of equal capacity in terms of our ability, intellectually, with only our background differentiating us, in terms of the expectations that we place upon our performance.  Why is it that we put up with hierarchy, despite the obvious truths concerning our equality, where we are capable of equality in any endeavour should we believe it of ourselves.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The truth, I think, stems from the great amount of influence held by some influential trading merchants, who have encouraged the hierarchical design of society into existence using a number of devices, primarily so that they can control, using hypnosis, the person at the top of society, in order to control those below.  When merchants had to plan the distribution of their goods to somewhere that was many nations distant at a time when only mules were available for transport, their ability to influence the markets at the other end of the trade routes became important.  Controlling those markets so that long distance trade would certainly make money became a justification, I suspect, for the deliberate control of our societies.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Religion has had an impact in creating that hierarchical distribution, and if one retains a rationalist interpretation of the roots of the Christian story, one might find that the story of Jesus was designed as a meme to deconstruct, and attack, Roman democracy.  The character of Jesus, where king of kings is an isomorph of Emperor, appeals as an internal icon, a bias on cognition, to those who are suffering.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In effect, it keeps them suffering, suffering at least poverty, which brings them closer to that icon.  At the same time the story of Jesus, spelt out as a logic, in terms of its bias on behaviour, that states that if one communicates to the people, and feeds them or attempts to heal them, then one will face a faked trial before being beaten by soldiers of the authority and then crucified.  It stops them from participating in democracy, and as it did, power became handed over to a different power structure, divided between the church and the monarchy/aristocracy as a system of guards.  I don’t want to get into any critique of the bible here, although I will write about it in the future.  However, at least some of it is worth acknowledging as a primary influence of our culturally supported status quo reality of a seemingly unfair distribution of wealth, something like 90% of the money in 10% of the hands.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One of the things that has created and maintained this hierarchical distribution of power and money, is the cultural ‘imprint’ from the impact on individual cognition of the story of Moses.  Such a high percentage of people worshipped in a way where that metaphorical story of Moses meeting God, where the rules of their law based group, written in stone, were handed directly from God, that the mountain’s pyramidal shape, has caused a bias towards hierarchical distributions in society.  The mountain radiates away from Moses and God, to the revelry and partying at the bottom of the mountain, as far away from God as can be imagined.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The consequence of this powerfully central metaphor is not only hierarchically organised society, but a widely held proscription by the Christian establishment against partying and revelry in society, motivating things like a ban on cannabis, whilst allowing wine, beer and spirits, which we had to fight for as individuals, against the Christian establishment.  When one examines the logic of prohibition one finds that it is both damaging and dangerous for individuals and society, but the establishment maintain a ban despite the logic.  In effect they are acting in a psychotic way, since it is so unjustifiable.  That psychotic manner develops from the cultural imprint on society of the hundreds of generations of Christians in society who held Moses meeting with God as central to their identity.  It is, as an iconograph, one of the only points where a human, that they can compare themselves to in their subconscious, is in direct contact with God.  And the rules are written in stone, unchangeable.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, continuing the examination of that psychological phenomenon, where the shape of our environment affects the shape of our input to that environment, one can see that there is an illogical, non sequitur that is one of the principle axioms underlying our economic reality.  This non-sequitur is that rare things should be more valuable.  The cause of this statement, that rarity is equivalent to value, most likely stems from the point at which one has to fund or finance a mission to find that rare item.  It costs more to underwrite an exploratory investigation in part due to the increased chance of finding nothing useful or productive at the end of it. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The ‘law’ of supply and demand seems to back up this non-sequitur, in the sense that if something is in short supply, then demand, as long as it outstrips supply, should mean a higher price.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, now think about the consequences of valuing rare things as being worth more.  First of all, the idea that those at the top of a hierarchy, who, in a pyramid shaped hierarchy are in less number than others, should be ascribed with greater value, and so the notion supports the idea that those ‘at the top’ should have greater amounts of money than those elsewhere in that societal distribution.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Then consider the situation we currently find ourselves in, with regards to the consequences of the disposable economy for the ecosystem.  The things that are in greatest supply, are often the things that we make no effort to keep.  If we were to value those things that are in greatest supply higher than those things that are rare, then we might find that we are better able to limit the wastage of those resources.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Finally, think about the way in which war occurs.  Where I can say it is true that in our cognitive acts we recapitulate our existing environment, in an environment where rare things are valued more highly than abundant things, then that abundant supply of humans that are the troops become less important than those at the ‘top’.  This has lead in the past to terrifying levels of waste of life.<br /><br />Is it possible to value things that are abundant more highly than things that are rare?  I cannot say, but I point out that if it were the case, then since economics is such a prominent part of our daily psychological environment, the impact would be felt immediately and in a wide ranging, positive set of consequences.   Perhaps rare things should be purchased and located by state funding.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A second ‘reality’, expressed as a truism, presents itself.  The phrase ‘all profit is loss’, seeks to illustrate that profit withdraws resources from that finite thing that is the amount of currency that can be worked with at any point.  That amount of currency is the systemic redundancy, i.e. the amount of currency that is present in the financial system that is available to represent the demands of the movement of goods on a day to day basis.  Profit draws from this finite, abstract, ‘pool’ that is the systemic redundancy.  In many cases this is not an issue, but in some modern forms of business, and product, it is leaving our economies destroyed.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In order to illustrate what I mean, consider the economy up until a hundred years ago.  If one sold some product, let’s say a chair, then the sale of that chair would mean that the nail maker, the upholsterer, the weaver, the glue manufacturer, and the maker of needles, and perhaps hammers, would see movement through their books.  This was the same for virtually every sale, and results in what I might call, a traditional robust-infrastructure economy.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Across the twentieth century, technology has allowed for the creation of new forms of product, that are not entwined with the rest of the products in that traditional manner.  By the time we arrive at the creation of computer software, which is perhaps the most exaggerated example of this phenomenon, we are already at a situation where the vast profits made by films are meaning that the systemic redundancy that is available in the economy is greatly diminished, taken up by those huge profits.  When a blockbuster film is made, it often makes back its costs in the first weekend of release, plus some (on a large scale – many millions).  As the film continues to exist, it presents a financial product that is only profit, since it can then be downloaded at a cost to the consumer, where that cost returns money to the ‘manufacturer’, and no other person is funded as the money changes hands.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When computer software is manufactured, no other industry makes any money at all, except possibly for the profits from coffee machines.  The product is so detached from any product that one might find in a traditional infrastructure-economy, that as it sells, its existence as a draw from the systemic redundancy of the greater economy is maximised to the extent that as soon as computer software became a major selling product in the early 1990s, the economy collapsed, although there were several other reasons for that.  But computer software, as a product that sees no parts of any other industry selling as it is sold, is an unhealthy product.  Films, from the point at which their costs are made back, are in the same category.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The result is an economy with very little spare room to move (systemic redundancy).  And products like films, aggregatively, year after year, continue to draw from the available amount of redundancy.  The consequences of that brittle state, is the continuous risk of collapse.  Add to that the fact that the post war economy in many countries centred around and has maintained as important, property development, which has then become central to our economies, and the fact that the mortgage market becomes saturated, leaving new housing having an impact on existing mortgages, and new mortgages being difficult to sell due to continuous threat of negative equity, and all in all we are facing a seriously impacted economic situation, and with the continued popularity of films and software, it is unlikely that anything other than some properly radical changes to the form of the economy will leave us experiencing any measure of economic prosperity.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There just isn’t the room to grow.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This fact is exemplified in considering the consequences of that fact that the national currency is a finite amount.  If it weren’t finite, and we just printed money then inflation would rise enormously, at the same time as the value of our goods would become diminished.  If there is X currency in the nation, and the product that I sell costs Y, then if I double X, Y has twice the amount of units available to represent it, and so it becomes devalued by half its value, in terms of money representing it.  It still has the same value, relatively speaking though, but when one compares it to its monetary value in other nation’s currencies, it is worth less than it was before, unless the currency exchange between those two nations is updated to allow for the doubling of amount of currency.  Though this is simplistic, the fact remains that the economy is healthier when we have a finite amount of currency.  The first thing that I want to point out about this, is that each currency, and all are comparable systems in this respect, has a fixed amount of systemic redundancy.  That thing, systemic redundancy is the amount of ‘spare cash’ that is held by the economy, so it is the amount of spare money that can be drawn upon to ease the passage of goods from one place to another.  When there isn’t enough systemic redundancy, the economy slows down, becoming brittle and crashing.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When I state that there is a fixed amount of systemic redundancy per national currency, I want to state that there is some percentage of currency that is redundant, and that in each national currency, that percentage is the same.  That percentage is a property, systemically, of currency generally.  So, when the European single currency was formed, 28 member states swapped their national currencies for the single currency.  In doing so, they swapped systemic redundancy across their nations that was of size 28 x the percentage of redundancy (which does not vary in size between the nations, since it is a fixed property of the system) and in its place they got 1 x the percentage of redundancy.  This left the European economy brittle and unworkable, with a 1/28th of the amount of redundancy that it had before the introduction of the single currency and as the single currency collapsed many member countries fell in to even greater debt.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Another property of economics, that seems to be conveniently overlooked, is the fact that because the currency is finite, the global economy describes a finite currency amount.  This leaves a topographic description of the global currency, where one draws a planar surface where when it is flat it is representative of the average GDP, so that poor nations are below that average and wealthy nations are above, expressed on that deformed planar surface, through their hierarchy as mountainous peaks.  If one remembers to keep that planar surface finite, then as one draws it up to represent the mountainous GDP peaks of the wealthy nations, the edge of that surface is drawn away from the poorer nations.  It is not quite the correct metaphor, but I hope it implies what I intend it to mean.  Because the economy globally is finite, the more power there is concentrated in one place, the less there will be somewhere else.  I think that you might find that there was a macro example of this when the European single currency was formed.  The wealthier nations of Germany and France immediately began to draw the finite currency towards themselves, and so the poorer nations, such as Portugal and Greece suffered the consequences.<br /><br />So, apart from the fact that the profits of a movie, available on Netflix or Amazon or some other pay to view streaming service, are not a complex infrastructure, feeding other parts of the economy as one might when a chair is sold, but as the profits are so vast, the wealth is drawn towards the producer, causing a famine of poverty elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As adults in this informed world, where we are no longer able to justify separating ourselves violently from other communities, we have an obligation to adopt a system of economics that works for all people, not just some.  The economy is not a place for war, competition or gambling.  Those things can all occur in computer games to satiate the continued cultural pressure upon people to engage in those behaviours.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">We are a species.  One species.  Won.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, whatever economic system we adopt, it must be realistic in its design about human psychology.  In the history of economics, every society to exist has always had at least three, sometimes a couple more, socio-economic brackets.  This, I would suggest is a psychologically induced systemic property.  The decision when purchasing is ‘yes, no, maybe’ and the continuous engaging in this question, which is an act of deictic reference, imbues the system with what coalesces to be three socio-economic pools.  The two others that sometimes occur are outside of the free market, as academics or priests, and the aristocracy.  In both cases choice is not something that is necessary, and the impact of their choice upon the pooling of society into three different socio-economic brackets is minimised.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I mean to spell this out because it is a systemic property that we can agree to maintain.  Why would we not choose some levelling equality system?  After all, we are all equal.  The reason is that to try and create one socio-economic bracket that we all inhabit, leaves us with less choice.  There are other systemic reasons, such as greater systemic redundancy for example, for maintaining three different places to live in our society.  As long as we maintain that we are all equal, and all capable of similar achievements, and maintain the property of social mobility for those who wish to move from one socio-economic bracket to another, then we keep the best and dispose of the worst.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Is there an economic system that might work to keep us healthy as the people of the world?  If there is, then it will be a system that works to keep our quality of life as similar without diminishing our choices in any way.  If one looks at a national currency then one finds that the nation is not homogeneous in its quality of life, and the currency does not really reflect any relationship with quality of life, outside of the retail price index.  What I propose to suggest is that the currency is a distributed system of accounting, one without a gatekeeper, and is so decentralised that corruption is diminished.  Imagine an alternative, where all of our goods as a community are placed in a storeroom, and we have to go and obtain those goods from that store.  The storeroom has a storeman.  I doubt that any storeman could be found for any multiple of the duration of their employment, where the storeman would always be perfectly incorruptible.  So, the decentralised nature of money leaves it capable of representing the movement of goods in a visible manner, but without a storeman, i.e. no gatekeeper.  Money is perhaps the most perfect system that humanity has ever achieved.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So the national currency represents the movement of goods in the nation, as well as to and from other nations.  I want to suggest that the resolution with which a national currency represents those goods, is far too low for it to be of any really purposive use.  In our inability to see properly what is happening, we are finding ourselves with space in which to gamble, compete and make war, all human traits that should be reserved for some less important domain, such as computer games.  What do I mean by resolution?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Before it became a single currency, the EEC, which preceded the European Union, had 28 different parts to its ultimate description of the European economy. Afterwards, it only had one.  This is different from systemic redundancy, it is a measure of our ability to see, through currency exchange, our moves towards a homogenous quality of life occurring.  It is only when we have a homogenous quality of life in Europe that we can properly consider ourselves to be one economic unit.  So, losing the resolution of the individual currencies was a drastic mistake.  The European economy had a ‘picture’ of its economic health that was divided into 28 individual pixels.  That is a very low resolution, I hope you will agree.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Imagine any picture made from 28 pixels.  It would be blocky and virtually impossible to make out any useful features with which to use to arrive at any understanding of what the picture represented.  So, if I were to replace the economic system, I might want to have as many units of currency as are possible.  I suspect that there is some absolute minimum size of area that could be used to describe the minimum size of a denomination of currency.  Perhaps a parish, or an area ten by five, like the island I live on, which has its own currency.  In realising this system, each denomination has an exchange rate with every other denomination.  The exchange rate is decided by distance in quality of life, perhaps modified by distance physically.  If each monetary unit describes a 50 square mile area, then there might 4,793 different currencies in France alone.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This might seem like an huge increase in red tape and calculations, but computational power affords us the opportunity to have a single app, or card with a computer on board, that shows items at the price that is shown in units of national currency, or even single currency, but which, behind the scenes, in a visible, introspectable manner, there is an exchange mechanism occurring.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I don’t quite know how such a thing might work, but I do know that the systems that we have inherited are badly defined and inefficient by our modern yardstick, now that we have computers and the internet.  I also know that the single greatest cause of war and hardship, is difference in quality of life, and this needs to be minimised, for us to have equality around the world.  Whatever system occurs though, needs to be designed with human fallibility in mind.  Inflation must never be allowed to occur to the extent that we lose the ability to empathise with one another in our respective socio-economic brackets.  When this occurs we are reaching the point at which we are not one society, but more than one.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Inflation can be addressed by design in a system that adjusts upper incomes, but in doing so, we touch upon unpopular assaults on what is perceived as freedom, and the lack of popularity is magnified due to those people affected having the greatest power over the cultural media.  They can shout louder than anyone else, and so can complain louder than anyone else.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The wealthy have no reason to fear, since they already have the greatest amount of money, and by definition can afford more than others.  However, they tend to worry more than others, since they have, in their wealthy situation, a greater attack surface that they must patrol, in some manner.  They have to remain observant more than others, for loss, since there are for the wealthy a greater amount of places where loss might occur.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Furthermore, since the brain keeps its information on the outside of itself, using its home environment as an unchanging, fixed, co-varying system of constraints upon recall, the poor, who put more effort into obtaining things that are in their environment, can relax their cognition more, when at home, than that person who can afford anything they want.  In practice, the wealthy have sentimental value attached to their property, where for the poor their property represents both sentimental value, plus the effort of acquisition.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">That effort of acquisition leaves them in a home environment where they have greater amounts of constraint on the representation of the events of their daily life.  They are less detached as a consequence, from society around them, although this possibility is a prediction of the model I have bourne out by personal observation to some extent.  Like everything else in this book, it is an unsubstantiated observation, and mentioned purely for the purpose of further research.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One can deduce properties of a perfect economy, and then find some workable form of system that maintains the existence of those properties.  One of those properties, should be that thing that is summed in the statement, ‘if the poorest members of the community have enough to keep the healthy and well, then all members of the economy have that health and well being’.   This rather obvious truism, means that one can only state that the economy is ‘working’ or ‘healthy’ when all people in the economy have at least their basic needs met.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">We, in Britain, have a system of national insurance, which means that no matter what our situation financially, we don’t have to worry about our health or other basic needs.  That is the ideal at least.  It is insurance because it protects our offspring from fear of poverty.  We then don’t have to worry so much about their well being.  For example, my grandparents were born into aristocracy, at least on my mother’s side, and I now live on benefits and income support in a state funded bedsit.  As the consequences of welfare have gripped our society, we have relaxed, and criminal activity has almost disappeared in comparison to that time before we had welfare, when we had no certain ability to be assured of the future well being of our children, and theirs.  So, national insurance, the national health system and the welfare model generally, should be a property of any systemic attempt to define an economy.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This chapter has touched upon some psychology but there has been discussion of systems generally, and I want to finish on that note.  Think of a complex system as the surface of a pond.  When one drops in a pebble, one cannot either necessarily predict what interference pattern will occur, or what distal effects, in terms of ripples etc might occur.  Again, not the best of metaphor, but what I am trying to point out is that a property of complex systems is our inability to know what distal consequences there might exist for our proximal interference with the system.  I suspect that what could be stated is that any point source interference, like the pebble, will have perturbations and consequences distally that one cannot predict, and that rather than point source interference, one can employ constraints that affect all comparable parts of that complex system equally.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A point source interference might be rent control.  Rent control, as a point source interference has distal consequences that involve a negative impact on at least some part of the economy.  Instead, one might adjust the operating conditions of rent and mortgages simultaneously, for all properties.  One is trying to adjust the environment in which the complex system exists, rather than adjust some sub-ordinate part of the complex system itself.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Whatever economic system we decide to live with, it must factor in as part of its functioning some aspect that works to protect the ecology of the planet.  I hear the news that multiples of football fields in size of rainforest is being cut down daily, and am concerned as everyone else for the flora and fauna that is lost, as well as the ecological impact upon the weather systems of the planet.  However, I am an Jerseyman, to some extent a Britain, and we cut down our forests over 600 years ago to make our formidable naval power.  How then, can we criticise those that are simply doing the same thing?<br /><br />It is a serious issue that is going to face us all.  In keeping with the rest of this book, I am going to make a novel suggestion concerning the problem of global warming, one that is as spurious as anything else I have suggested, but one that, like the other novelties, is just about tenable enough to be worth considering for future investigation and research.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I suggest that the atmosphere of the planet, viewed from one perspective, is like a balloon, in that it is inflated to some extent.  The source of inflation of the balloon are the atmospheric gases that we breathe, what we call air, 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and the rest as trace gases, including carbon dioxide.  I will also suggest that the upper atmosphere has weight, and mass.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As the rainforests, and other forests that filter carbon-dioxide into oxygen have been cut down, there is a great increase in the level of carbon-dioxide.  At the same time as 80% deforestation of the planet has occurred, over roughly 100 years, the human population has massively increased, to 7 billion individuals breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon-dioxide.  I am going to suggest that the atmosphere has ‘deflated’, due to carbon dioxide not supporting the atmosphere in the same way that oxygen does.  Having deflated, the upper limits of the atmosphere are trapped between the outside surface of the inner atmosphere, that we breathe, and the outer surface of the atmosphere where atmosphere ends and space begins.  Because that area is in between two spheres, one smaller than than the other, the area that it occupies is greatly condensed, a consequence of the fact that spheres, having no edges, describe some relationship with an infinite quantity.   Whether or not that relationship holds, the fact that the dust and other particles in that condensed area are then closer to each other, is going to leave them colliding with greater frequency, which is going to cause an increase in heat.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">We don’t see this currently.  We consider that greenhouse gases are the cause, but there are economic reasons supporting this conclusion, as well as political historical reasons stemming from the smog over London in the 1950s, and the fervour with which some took up the pursuit of publicising the benefits of nuclear power.  Greenhouse gases, which are undoubtedly real and have an impact upon the temperature of the planet are focused upon, but I suggest that the condensed area, which leaves that section of atmosphere with greater density, and thus increases the gravitational coefficient of the planet by increasing its bearing upon the core of the planet, also increases in heat, due to the greater number of collisions of particles as I stated before. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">That heat then moves to the poles due to the spiralling winds of the atmosphere, where the increased heat serves, in part, to melt the ice caps.  When ice melts, carbon-dioxide is released, and as the salt water of the ocean is filled with the fresh water of the polar ice caps, the freezing point of the water raises.  This alone increases the chance of the possibility of an ice age occurring, but added to this is the fact that as the polar ice cap water falls into the sea, it is forced, I suspect, to pool between thermoklines, sudden changes in temperature, and becomes a second ‘ocean’ underneath the surface of the ocean.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This submerged ‘ocean’ then starts to form a wave, that affects the pressure systems of the planet accordingly, and eventually this wave breaks the thermokline meniscus, and becomes a tsunami like wave that hits the land.  It cools down the surface of the land, preparing it to freeze, as part of the emergence of the ice age.  The surface of the land is already experiencing cooling from rain that is cooled due to the melting of the ice caps.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I mentioned that the gravitational coefficient of the planet changes.  This is a prediction based on a model of gravity that sees the aggregative spin of atoms throughout the solar system being responsible for gravity local to the planet.  Gravity on the moon, and also Mars, is lower than the gravity we have on planet Earth.  It is fair to suggest then, that the planet’s molten core is a cause of that increased gravity.  The suggestion that when materials are complex enough and identical enough that they attract one another, is an unsubstantiated premise of this argument, but if it is true then it might suggest that the proximity of the sun to the planet Earth increases the gravitational impact of the planet’s molten core.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">If we were to move Planet Earth to a greater distance away from the sun, gravity would diminish to some extent.  That we have an elliptical orbit might suggest that there might be an observable effect of the different points that we find ourselves in terms of our distance from the sun, but our gravitational coefficient may well express itself as a consequence of that elliptical orbit.   I don’t know enough about any subject really, to draw any firm conclusions, but I am relatively certain that the ‘quantum theoretic’ approaches to describing matter, are not necessarily as competent as one might expect at providing a reference description of physical reality.  Rather the quantum theories are simply covariant with the described reality, so they produce results, but this is coincidence.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Quantum theory starts with an axiomatic observation related to interference patterns, but I question the leap of faith that states that Quanta are certainly in evidence as a consequence of the interference patterns of slit experiments.  I would like to know whether the thickness of the material used has an bearing in terms of its gravitational impact on a passing photon, and if that statistically, over a number of photons, would give a resulting interference pattern, of that which stimulates people to decide that the fridge light is both on and off at the same time.  The cat though, is enjoying the box if it is alive.  I mean to mock what is blatantly nonsense.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The metaphor employed, ‘Schroedinger's cat’ is simply a method of describing belief, and those that tackle with the metaphor, end accepting fact by convention, the hallmark of any religion.  The cat in the box metaphor, is distinctly begging the question.  Can the cat be both dead and alive?  Is there an afterlife?  I mean to point to an underlying semiotic isomorphy between the two questions.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I see Freud’s psycho-analytic theories as the work of an earlier Freud, a neuroscientist, whose ideas were hypnotically ‘built over’.  The three principal drives, become the ego, super ego and id, amongst other ideas.  The quantum theory explanation of physical phenomena, at that particularly exclusive level of visibility, is most likely a similar thing.  It allows a controlling power, to erect a semiotically distinct level of description, interposed between the visible phenomenon and the theoretic that describes it.  This allows that power control over the presentation of consequences of physical phenomenon.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Science as the new religion is a rather terrifying prospect, since religion at that level that it is epistemically meaningful is so replete with charlatanism and psychological methods of diminishing freedom that if the same power is moving in to the disguise of science then we are facing more war and other wastes of time, as these liars battle it out for the money.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The quantum computer beckons.  I once, whilst deep in thought, decided that since a sphere has no edges, it can describe infinity.  I used that to suggest that when we divide any number by zero the result is infinity.  Imagine a 6 sided dice.  It is a cube.  Imagine a 20 sided dice.  It is becoming more spherical.  Imagine an infinite sided dice.  It would be a perfect sphere.  So the sphere has the ability to represent infinity.  It can also represent zero, since it has zero edges.  And it has one surface.  So, it can represent, one, zero, and any number to infinity and beyond.  Buzz Light-year aside, I suspect that there is a way of using this observation about a sphere, to represent any number, such that one can maximise bandwidth, with an ability to depict any number using the same amount of space.  Infinite bandwidth.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">When the quantum computer, which we shall sit upon and spin, only if we have large money, arrives, will its internals be visualisable, or will they be only describable in the sacred, secret, terms of Quantum theory?  Excuse my cynicism, but we are talking money at the moment, and the possibility that we get a third order semiotic description of reality, with an intervening layer that is only understood by some inaccessible group wishing to pursue an advantage over the rest of us, is simply our experience of life so far, and in particular the development of twentieth century science, at least for the last 40,000 years or so.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">To conclude this chapter then, I meant to point out that any system that we choose must be justifiable to all, and must allow social mobility between socio-economic levels, and must conform to good systems design.  The smallest area of currency offers the greatest resolution of picture and a far greater level of systemic redundancy.  Competition should be replaced by collaboration.  There is no extant reason why we should compete.  It is simply a leftover from our history of asking questions later, and attacking first.  We should not need competition, to motivate us.  We should follow models of efficiency as a sufficient yard stick, and not mistake efficiency for total use of some resource.  Efficient models of economics leave spare room to move.  The economy should support good models of ecology.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Right now, if I am correct about the diminishment in oxygen causing a ‘deflation’ of the atmosphere, to the extent that the heated inner surface of the atmosphere is moving as heat up to the poles, then we can attempt to ‘reinflate’ the planet’s atmosphere.  Grass roofs and living walls are most likely the answer, opening up an entirely new industry, of retro fitted plant racking systems, to the end that every square meter of our properties are producing oxygen, to offset our carbon dioxide footprint as a species. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">On that note, complex systems, which you are of course, as readers, I will finish my polemic, which leaves only the conclusion.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:24.0px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter 39:</span> <a id="a915Conclusion"></a>Conclusion – The materialist psychology of 	consciousness</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	REWRITE THIS</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, what I have presented in this book are the summarised details of the interests and insights that I have been pursuing.   Some of these, like consciousness, and also death, stretch back to my University days.  Others, like the section on taxes are more recent insights, having been developed during the course of the last ten years or so, a period I refer to as ‘interrogation by thieves’ and describe in appendix B.  Of those more recently developed insights, I have been encouraged to develop what seem like ‘schizotypal’ theories, logically unjustified observations with no empirical support, that will render a false diagnosis that was made of me, into an unquestionably true statement about my identity.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Messianic narcissism is, in my opinion, the ‘diagnosis’ that I am being prepared for, and and that I would presume to converse about the subjects contained in this book as though I have some justified ability to, can presumably draw that rhetorical weapon, that ad hominem diagnosis.  In the past I have been ‘diagnosed’ in a similar manner as a person suffering from delusions of grandeur with over-intellectualisation being raised to describe the type of language that I use.  Simply a psychiatric tool, part of their rhetoric.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I have fought to keep the nature of the insights presented in this book as rational. As I had a passing interest at University in the field of epistemology, I had drawn some conclusions about what makes a theory valid, and these include the ability to test the predictions that they make, as suggested by the scientific model, but also incorporate the potential to use a model as an epistemically valid source of confirmation of some phenomenon or other.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The model I pursue is one of machine consciousness.  Furthermore, the model that I present is certainly based on my experience with health professionals, which has led me to question the standard model, to the extent that much of what I present may not co-exist with the standard chemical model, as some other level of description.  I even question accepted statements such as the idea that there is a bipartite distinction between the Central Nervous System and the Peripheral or autonomous nervous system.  I don’t think that mind is aware of the separation, which as a distinction is one that I suggest that has been made ex post facto by clinicians and researchers for the sake of ease of summarisation of phenomenon, and which appeals to those who like to see duality, a sort of enforced dualism for compatibilist reasons, almost like the cognitive science hardware/software distinction that proves, in my opinion, to be so unreal.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I would even go so far as hazarding a guess that the glands do not produce hormones, instead scraping the excess from the cardiovascular system, where lubrication for viscosity is necessary to augment from time to time.  That would make sense, in that the thyroid is responsible for augmenting the viscosity of blood through the introduction of testosterone or similar, for the sake of achieving good hydraulic pressure where the jaw and frontal lobes, and eyes are all at 90 degrees to the canonical pole of cardiovascular pressure.  No system is any good at all, where it does not have systemic redundancy.  Where it has no redundancy, then it is a perfect description, and is unable to move, to adapt.  So, glands sit around and scavenge or scrape excess amounts of mineralocorticoids so that they can release them at a later date as a form of systemic redundancy.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Likewise the gonads are necessary to release viscosity adjusting mineralocorticoids when erection occurs, which is a phenomenon that affects both men and women, just in case you don’t know.  Women experience a tightening of the vagina as the blood pressure increases during arousal, where men experience an erection.  Why would I suggest that the glands do not ‘manufacture’ hormones?  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Because, it is not necessary to.  The stomach and the chyme from digestion is enough to provide the adrenal glands with a ready supply of serotonin that is then filtered as it passes through the adrenals and into the cardiovascular system, into the separate components of serotonin, such as oestrogen and testosterone, as well as aldosterone and others.  Of course, it is only a guess, and like all my other unsubstantiated guesswork, is presented purely for interest and to perhaps stimulate or augment research in those areas that I discuss.  However, I am aware that there are ‘dialogues’ within scientific establishments that are perpetuated as accepted fact and are constrained as much by a lack of self confidence on the part of the scientists, as any other dialogue in any other group.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">We are scared of looking embarrassed, and it is one of the weaknesses of the current system of the practice of the scientific method that one invests oneself fully so much in one particular logical position, that one’s career can fall apart if that logical position is then demonstrated to be false.  Where those scientists who have accepted some truth make up the ‘upper echelons’ of some scientific field, their desire to not affect their career of pronouncements sees them disregarding novelty as spurious, without, I think, enough careful examination.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I think that has been the case from time to time, but I cannot be certain, as I am not studied in the field of the history of the practice of science.  It is, however, one of the more intelligent findings of recent science, in my opinion, that any good epistemic system should contain reflexivity to some degree, and the practice of science is not exempt from this criticism.  It should be continuously under review and contain some self focused commentary.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As I developed my psychological knowledge, I was able in increasing amounts to make out the outline of a set of techniques, employing observations of materialist nature, for the malevolent control of the people, their purchasing tendencies, their voting etc.  I didn’t really start examining the malevolent sphere of influence of the less than ethically sound human beings using these techniques, until the ‘interrogation’ (described in appendix B) was in full swing, as the thieves encouraged me, through suggestion, to believe that I was witnessing the sum total of human evil, playing on their ability to induce messianism in their victims.  I played along, for the greater part, waiting for my opportunity to contact a relevant authority.  Their hope though, was to draw an illusion of me as a paranoid individual, the false diagnosis that they had used to imprison me in preparation for the ‘interrogation’.<br /><br />	My comprehension of materialist psychology, which leaves me with a visualisable model that makes reasonably accurate predictions (although this needs testing by some epistemic framework that is greater than just my eyes alone), allowed me to defend myself against the techniques of the thieves, at least to some extent that is greater than they would have preferred.  I eventually realised that some paradigm shift must have occurred in the history of the study of psychology, some time around the point at which the psycho-physiologists fell out of favour, and were replaced by what seems like a dichotomy of extremes, with behaviourism on one side, and psycho analysis on the other.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Examining Freud’s work, one can make the suggestion that the language that he chose to use, was a label for real neuroscientific observations.  It can be stated that there are three major drives for cognition, the food drive, the libidinal drive, and the intellectual drive, for example, which may have inspired Freud’s definition of the id, the ego, and the super-ego.  Freud began his scientific life as a neuroscientist so this may be the case.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I suspect what has happened is that the psychophysiologists have chanced upon the discovery of how hypnosis works, i.e. that there is a level of audiological volume in which speech can be presented to the person and the person will respond, but not be consciously aware of either hearing the dialogue or responding to it.  That they might have discovered this, as they examined the just noticeable and least noticeable difference, is quite likely, and at a time, when the powers that use hypnosis for advantage were witnessing the birth of potential hypnotic aids such as microphones and speakers.  Those powers were engaged in attempts to control the opium trade at the time, and it has been my observation that methods of hypnosis often accompany a coincidental use of some substance or other that facilitates the suggestible state, and I suspect this is what was motivating the aggression over the opium wars.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	I have presented in this book, hopefully, what is an outline argument for the justification of seeing how the body works to support the creation of the phenomenon of self, at the physical level, rather than the fashionable but utterly unintrospectable chemical level.  Whilst the methods of materialist psychology can be exploited by criminals, the same is true of any explanation.  A good understanding of materialist psychology though, leaves the individual with a definitely improved ability to defend themselves against any malevolent attack, at least that is my supposition, and it seems to have proved to be reasonably true, through my experiences, which I outline in appendix B.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	A reasonable working knowledge of materialist psychology at the physical level can also can be applied in many areas, in order to help people over come difficulties. Consider the case of a geriatric individual who is beginning to experience dementia. The first thing that one might be able to state is that the manner in which the geriatric individual rehearses stories is entirely normal, and indicative of the weakened endogenous control that faces the elderly, as their drives diminish in their power.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	As the individual moves into a nursing home, the individual faces a situation where suddenly the recall that is supported by the environment of their home, is diminished entirely.  The phenomenon presents itself as elderly people going to nursing homes to die, since their cognitive system suddenly becomes overloaded by the lack of support of the configuration of their home environment.  One can move the pictures on the walls of their home environment to the nursing home, and in their room in that nursing home, put the pictures on the wall making sure that the same canonical orientation of the pictures to one another and to the gross psychological co-ordinates of the room, such as windows and doors, is maintained.  This should, in theory, leave the individual with more support for the maintenance of their recall in an unstressed way.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	The configuration of the home and the way in which that anchors self, is also useful to understand when giving up smoking.  In the process of giving up smoking, one can use patches and leave oneself with a steady background level of nicotine that is so high that it hides the spike of nicotine receptors when they are provoked by environmental stressors.  Due to this, one can slowly disconnect oneself from those environmental stressors.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	One thing that is helpful when going through this process, is to understand that one wants to minimise the power of those stressors in the home, which one can do by moving pictures around, painting the walls a different colour, and by using a new type of fragrance in the rooms in question.  All of these things adjust the external environment so that it no longer represents the trigger for nicotine spikes that it does through secondary association.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	The subject of cardiovascular hydraulics is a new thing as far as I know.  There may be an entire school of thought and publications that examine the issue.  I am fairly aware that no matter how much one researches a subject, there may always be some other, studying the same thing.  I recall at university how I began to understand that some universities have access to some journals, and other universities to others, perhaps for political reasons, as well as there being different areas of interest in different universities in different nations.  I had many of these ideas, more than ten years ago, but many of them may have found expression in universities since then; that is the nature of the zeitgeist.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Cardiovascular hydraulics is a particularly important subject for students of mental health, in my opinion.  All mental health issues have at least some attentional component, too much or too little fixation.  That those attentional issues are due to an adrenal circuit that can not compensate for some consequence of extended stress is to my mind, almost certainly one of the causes of mental health issues.  Saunas, and other methods of encouraging good cardiovascular tone, are indicated by this observation.  Badminton, where the brain has to regularly plan sudden changes of move for the bubble of blood that we are as individuals, is undoubtedly a good activity to regain good mental health.  Needlework, music or some other form of absorbing pastime, where error is immediately rewarded with some visible or perceivable consequence is also particularly important; what I refer to as ‘western meditation’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	Ultimately, this ‘book’ is for personal purposes, to illustrate a set of phenomenon, that I would like to seek support for, through research.  I hope to have illustrated that a visualisable physical model that makes accurate predictions is of more use to a person than the vagaries of some overly complex chemical model.  One of the greatest causes of ill health is stress, and particularly where the cardiovascular hydraulics of the individual are biased by their worry and concern.  A visualisable model could be made out of four tubs of coloured lard for all it matters, as long as the predictions that it makes with regards to the outcomes of interventions are accurate, then it is a successful model.  Where it is easily brought to mind, less stress is incurred.  This is the opposite of the ‘little knowledge is a dangerous thing’ model of people as hypochondriacs.  Instead it seeks to empower the people with a realistic model that is accurate to the point of making successful predictions about interventions.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	The chapters that I have included about cancer and diabetes for instance, are most likely encouraged, through suggestion, in order to discredit me.  When I began I had an understanding of distal PTSD and the ubiquitous nature of PTSD like events in the cognitive life of human beings, and the way in which these, unresolvable neural complexes, eat into the available attentional resources.   That was all I had since it was my interest. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	However, just about every mental health issue that you might care to mention, is in my opinion, brought into existence because of a diminished amount of endogenous attentional control, particularly in the adrenal circuit, and so in describing this reality, and providing an acceptable comprehension of how EMDR works, to the extent that the visualisable model of EMDR’s functioning by the patient, would empower its success.  In that case, since PTSD like cognitive processes, distal or not, are the cause of the mental health issues though diminishing the available attentional resources of the individual, one finds, in EMDR, potentially, a cure that will render many medical pharmaceutical stock portfolios greatly diminished in terms of their value, as many people may be entirely cured simply by application of this simple procedure.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, I found myself overworking the description, and engaging with the ‘messianic’ ‘vision’ of the way in which these other illnesses might be.  They are described at the level of the physical though, and are worth considering, even if it is purely to discount them, so I leave them in, with this caveat here, that warns that they are most likely more than a little ‘fruity’.  Such is discreditation, something I am facing in many different ways at the moment.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	As for the description of death, I have not really done it justice, since it requires more space than I wish to allot it here.  I first had the idea in 1998, and since then have been experiencing an extended stay within the boundaries of a form of prison, the walls of which are invisible, to prevent me from getting out, the mental health ‘diagnosis’.  Whilst this has been going on, over the last two decades, Hollywood has been pushing out blockbuster after blockbuster concerning immortality and infinity and time travel, parodying the statement that I made, and bringing the subject firmly into the comedic area that is occupied by conspiracy theorists and other questionable types.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	The theory that I present, threatens an establishment who found their power on the ability to use suggestion, where susceptibility to hypnosis is dependent largely on the fear of confrontation that the individual has, and that fear of confrontation is almost certainly forced into existence in those who are scared of death, particularly of a judgement that occurs after reaching that unknown, unseeable place.<br /><br />	The power of these criminals that use large scale hypnotic suggestion has been enormously empowered by the advent of microphones, speakers, and computers.  The human being responds to sounds that it can not consciously report.  This observation is probably one of the original sources of what came to be described as the soul, I suspect, but as a phenomenon it is entirely used by any power that wishes to suggest that it is ‘doing its best’ to ‘defend’ its charges.  The only ethically valid position on the use of such tools though, is to throw every resource in to preventing it from happening.  In the case of vulnerable people, such as those potentially experiencing mental health issues, a black box camera should be present, accessible only by members of some authority, the government perhaps, and only for situations of dispute, or where criminal activity by the health professional is alleged.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I hope that you have found the book interesting, and perhaps even thought provoking. I know that it is all unsubstantiated, but that is the nature of supposition; knowledge starts as a glimmer of recognition, before empirical support is found. Even when that empirical support is found, the description of reality that is supports may be biased.  An example is the pervasive leaning towards compatibilist definitions of reality, that seek some ‘harmony’ between the prevailing view of the separate nature of soul and body found in religious philosophy and some scientific model.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Cognitive science, to my mind, is one of the more prolific examples of this type of bias.   Another might be the idea that there is an ‘eve’ from whom all modern humans evolved.  It is a compatibilist notion with some notional ‘garden of Eden’ being presented as a potential reality.  It is far more likely that there has been a potential to reach the ‘eve’ conclusion due to missing fossil records, and a bias to select it as a theory due to some compatibilist desire.  I greatly suspect that the truth, by the way, is that whilst we might have branched, as a species, in the rift valley, or possibly following its creation, we were monkeys, rather than proto-humans when we spread out across the face of the Earth.  It was only then when we were a similar species, stretched across the planet’s surface, that an ice age, and the subsequent melt of the ice, left us as monkeys, all around the world, facing a similar environmental evolutionary pressure to stand upright, the water supporting our change in stance and gait.  The loss of a tail, might encourage better swimming, for instance.  This suggestion does not imply a ‘first cause’ or ‘first location’ or any other human error or bias.  It finds currency, perhaps, in the suggestion that human thought is biased to accept the limited range of the very greatly incomplete fossil record. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As for machine consciousness, I imagine a world in which we attain the perfect democracy, which is that place we have sought to recreate since its existence, in Greek times.  The problem though, amongst others, is that in Greek times the voting public had time on their hands as they had slaves who did the work for them.  I hope that we never once see an instance of RoboCop, or RoboSoldier, and rather see many conscious machines all helping us as humans out of the slavery of work in this pin factory panopticon that we have built for ourselves.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-size:18.666668px">    The following essay is an essay that I wrote in 2004, after having been placed in St Saviour’s hospital, a mental health facility.  I had been sectioned for no particular reason, except perhaps that I was planning to leave the island.  I wrote the essay to remind myself in the future where I had been in terms of my reasoning about PTSD, and also whilst I could still write in something approaching a scientific style of writing.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;text-align:center;font-weight:bold">A Brief discussion concerning CSA related PTSD</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In this essay I intend firstly to challenge the existing diagnostic criteria associated with PTSD with a view to broadening the scope of its probable aetiology.  Secondly, I will describe a new theoretical level of explanation that is gaining ground within the field of Psychology before examining what relevance this has with regards to an analysis of the relationship between Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) and PTSD.  Finally, I will describe the consequences of CSA and a therapeutic intervention that seems to help with those consequences as understood from within this novel framework.  Whilst I will try to be consistent in terms of the underlying logic of my arguments, please forgive my lack of referencing as I do not currently have the necessary access to the relevant materials.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I include a copy of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD  that I have taken from a textbook printed in 2003.  The diagnostic criteria belong to the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM IV) and taking into account the fact that information in textbooks is generally at least three years out of date at time of publication, there exists the possibility that the criteria have been revised<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn8" id="bodyftn8">8</a></span>.  Whilst I understand that the British and European equivalent of the DSM employ a system of diagnosis that allows more freedom of interpretation, the DSM seems to hold sway as the most objective definition of the underlying symptomatology that is present when faced with the deeply interesting but somewhat unenviable task of making a differential diagnosis.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Post traumatic stress disorder was identified only recently, and is most commonly associated with severe trauma and shock.  In fact, it is now thought that the syndrome that affected many soldiers after the first world war, known as ‘shell shock’, was what we now term PTSD.  More recently, a group of soldiers who fought in the first Gulf War were identified as experiencing the symptoms of PTSD<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:58%;vertical-align:super"><span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn9" id="bodyftn9">9</a></span></span> and following the attention that this brought to the study of PTSD, more cases were identified, notably in the case of the survivors of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise car ferry.  From its inception to the current date, the clinical diagnosis of PTSD has been specifically associated with severe trauma and this is reflected in one of the principal diagnostic criteria of the DSM definition: criterion A1 : The person experienced, witnessed , or was confronted with an event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">As far as I understand, the original definition of PTSD did not include the concept of threat of harm.  The definition has been revised to include this.  Revisions to the DSM are common as we expand our understanding of the various conditions and their symptoms, particularly when a syndrome such as PTSD is in its infancy in diagnostic terms.  There are now and have been for a while, a group of clinicians and others who have been attempting to expand the definition of PTSD to include, not only ‘…<span style="font-style:italic">actual or threatened death or serious injury…’</span> but also to consider it a consequence of child abuse.  It is my belief that many environmental effects may result in some or all of the traumatic symptoms of PTSD, the quantity and type of symptoms being affected by the type of environmental trauma and the individual’s ability to process that trauma ( a diathesis/stressor model, mediated by environmental influences such as amount and type of social support amongst others ).  It is also my belief that child abuse, particularly CSA, <span style="font-style:italic">definitely</span> results in some or all of the symptoms of PTSD and it is under this supposition that this essay will continue.  Before beginning, why do I personally believe that victims of CSA will experience PTSD?  The first reason is the weakest and this is personal experience.  When I have examined how I existed as a person before I had the systematic eye de-sensitization I can recognise many of the symptoms of PTSD.  I believe this is more than just the vagaries of deluded hypochondria<span style="color:#ff0000">.</span>  I am cannot say that I am particularly well read on the subject of the consequences of sexual abuse as I have avoided the literature but long before I came upon the DSM or even heard of PTSD I was able to know of several symptoms that I experienced which I put down in some way to what I had experienced as a youngster.  These symptoms and others seemed to be obvious when speaking to other individuals who had suffered a childhood trauma and if enough of them were present I could with almost certainty state that that individual had experienced sexual abuse.  I once tested this ability over a period of time.  In the cases where I was absolutely certain that an individual had experienced sexual abuse, I let them know that I had experienced it.  I have found that speaking about my own situation generally allows other individuals to speak freely about their own problems and eight out of the ten people that I suspected admitted that they had been sexually molested.  I did not get the opportunity to ask the other two people so I personally count this as a 100 per cent success rate.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">An extreme caveat ought to be outlined here.  Many different types of childhood trauma and other types of trauma can result in the types of symptoms that I was looking for.  I was only able to assess the situations of these ten adult individuals because I set the highest of inclusion criteria in that they had to have experienced virtually all of the symptoms that I was looking for.  I also feel that I may have used a certain level of intuition.  However, and this is an argument used to support the presence of the DSM itself, until there is an explicit outline of the symptomatology associated with a condition, there can be no clear definition of which individuals to study in order to find a method of helping those individuals.  At the time that I considered these ten people (in my second year at university) I had not come across PTSD and did not know of the association between PTSD and CSA.  However, when I did encounter the clinical definition of PTSD, I recognised all of the symptoms both in myself, others and in the criteria I had employed to make my judgements about those ten people.  For reasons of brevity I will not list in full the particular symptoms that I mean but instead will refer to them by their DSM reference:</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">B1 : This is for me, the hallmark of PTSD and in individuals who experience PTSD as a result of CSA or any trauma that occurred a significantly long time ago, I believe that the flashbacks may not be experienced phenomenologically in conscious awareness but the physical symptoms are apparent.  These usually result in an individual who will stare into space frequently, giving the impression of somebody who day-dreams, of somebody who will be in mid conversation and who will, after a brief pause, seem rather distracted and lost for words.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">B4. , B5. , C1. , C2. , C3. , C4. , C5, C7, D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , E and F all seem to occur in individuals who have experienced CSA.  There are other symptoms, not present in the DSM diagnostic criteria, that occur, in my experience, in individuals who have experienced CSA.  As I will further discuss below PTSD seems to lead to a form of attentional deficit disorder.  It is my belief that a section of individuals who have experienced CSA before the age of ten or eleven begin to experience some of the negative consequences of CSA when they reach this age.  Many people who were avid readers, and who were well behaved before this age lose the ability to read and their social behaviour is also negatively affected.  I believe that this belies an attentional disorder.  I believe that it would be a mistake to attribute this entirely to the onset of puberty but would be better considered within a framework that involves the concept of moral reasoning.  It is at around the age of ten, I believe, that a child generally achieves Kohlberg’s ‘conventional’ level of moral reasoning and it is the extra effort or inability to integrate their personal experience into their newly forming schemas of social aptitude that results in a high cognitive load which affects their ability to provide a sufficiently effective attentional resource.  This affects their ability to integrate both socially and cognitively leading to behavioural problems, under achievement at school and bad impression management.  In the same way, as I will discuss below, I believe that the memory of an integrity threatening or traumatic event such as CSA is sufficient in itself to elicit the symptoms of PTSD.  This means that individuals who have recovered repressed memories or even those who have constructed false memories will experience PTSD and it’s associated consequences.  The DSM included symptoms are a subset of the criteria that I used.  I continue to refuse to discuss any complete set of diagnostically appropriate criteria that might be used to better inform any individual as to whether another individual might or might not have experienced CSA as my own personal experience of our current societal situation with regard to CSA is that there are many apparently professional organisations that attempt to establish whether a case history of CSA is in existence and then justify a negative action against the individual who has suffered CSA through some misapplication of a logic that has its roots in the adage that 'the abused abuse', an unfortunately enduring nonsense that has resulted in a modern day witch hunt. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The second reason that I have for believing that CSA results in some or all of the symptoms of  PTSD is again personal and therefore logically weak.  It is that having suffered for many years from many of the symptoms of PTSD I finally went to see someone who dealt specifically with this trauma and who used a relatively novel technique to help me.  Whilst many other things happened at the time and, of course, since, I am almost certain that it was this therapy that helped me.  I have not experienced depression, low self esteem, lack of self confidence in social situations or an inability to concentrate since the time of the therapy.  Whilst in itself, my testimony provides no evidence for the efficacy of systematic eye desensitisation, I believe that a sufficient evidence base will undoubtedly emerge, given enough time and research.  Unfortunately, there is considerable resistance to the possibility of this form of therapy for reasons that stem from both economic self interest and philosophical bias and this resistance does not lend itself to an environment that will encourage research in this area.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The third reason that I have for believing that CSA results in PTSD is that there is a strengthening group of clinicians who feel that that the possible diagnosis of PTSD for individuals who have experienced CSA should be considered by those helping them.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	A fourth reason is that there now exists a movement in psychology who can provide a theoretical underpinning of those consequences and it is that theory that I will examine now.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The movement in Psychology that I refer to is called embodied cognition or situated cognition or more simply, embodiment (Clark, 1997, Varela, Thompson and Rosch, date unknown).   It has been referred to as ‘…the perennial recycling of behaviourism…’ but when examined deeply is far more than this.  Embodiment provides a synthesis to a once dominant thesis of behaviourism and it’s contemporary antithesis, cognitivism.  Embodiment recognises that the human body has evolved primarily for the purpose of action and movement and that cognition and higher forms of behaviour are built upon these first principles.  It does borrow heavily from the lexicon and conceptual consequences of behaviourism but uses the philosophical tools of cognitivism to allow the analysis of the human condition.  Essentially embodiment is a way of rejecting the fallacies that have come to exist in the rather stagnant theoretical ball-ground of cognitivist theorising without losing the benefits that functional analysis and transcendental deductionism have afforded us.  The result of such a comprising move forward is that very often, what will be being described will sound very much like cognitivism and at other times will sound very much like the theories that resulted from some of the behaviourist thinkers.  Any idea though will be based around the principle that the brain is a tool that has evolved to allow us to convert stimuli, both in the environment and internally, into action.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	An idea with its roots in cognitive science is the concept of the mental model.  This is a model, partially abstracted from the current environment and partially constructed from learnt experience, that we construct in our ‘mind’ that is interposed between environmental event and action that allows us to predict the consequences of our behaviour and, if necessary, inhibit the actions that are afforded.  There are some theorists within the field of Psychology that consider that there is very little phenomenal ‘distance’ between the external environment and our mental representation of it such as the Dynamic System Theorists or the Ecological Psychologists following Gibson(1956a) whilst the cognitivists might posit a series of discrete attentionally mediated steps 'updating' the model.  The model is in actuality, a </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"> </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Whilst there is no evidence base that I currently know of to support such a supposition(although I suspect this argument exists and is current), I believe that animals that exist at a lower stage on the phylogenetic scale experience their environment in a manner more akin to what the dynamic system theorists suggest and that as one examines species higher and higher on that scale there are more processes mediating between the perception of the environment and the actuation of responses to that environment.  When considering humans and mammals that live in social environments there are attentional processes operating on external environmental cues and internal aspects of the mental model that allow an inhibition of responses to environmental stimuli and these inhibitory responses are learnt according to the rules of social existence.  Humans are continuously processing a model of the external environment, not a model that can be considered an image of what is or what may be but instead is the sum total of all neural activation that would result from activating a particular muscle, or sets of muscles in response to a particular environmental event.  The phenomenological result of these sets of activation is that we are occasionally able to experience a mental ‘image’ of the external environment.  The neurons that are activated are not only those that relate to responses but to a large network of neurons underlying the activation of the response that form the basis of a distributed representation of that response.  With the response inhibited at some later stage, the activated network of neurons is the ‘memory’ – it is this memory that plays a part in the construction of a mental model.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The mental model that we have constructed is continuously being inspected, that is we are allocating attentional resources to allow a closer examination of certain aspects of the model.  This allows us to make predictions about actions and decide whether or not we want the consequences of our actions and, if not, to inhibit those actions.  These processes, are of course, below our conscious awareness although we may occasionally get a hint of their existence when we experience déjà vu and flashbacks such as those associated with PTSD.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It is not only the external environment that can influence the construction of the mental model.  The internal environment in terms of our feelings, emotions and memories also influence the form of the model.  The process of creating the model is entirely dynamic, in a constant state of fluidity and is distributed across a large amount of neurons at a sub-symbolic level.  All of the influences on building the model are integrated in this dynamic fashion and the model itself becomes more and more biased to acting in a certain fashion until at some point the physical response occurs.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">An important thing to note in terms of the focus of this essay is that competition between possible responses to the model at any time is gauged by recent and frequently occurring patterns of neuronal activity.  These patterns of activity may either have been encountered with some frequency or may be associated with a strong emotional content.  They have been called Schemas within cognitive psychology and I call them models here and are isomorphic with the forming model.  Isomorphism refers to the phenomenon where ideas are similar not because they are about the same thing but because the logical relationship between their respective items of representational content are similar, which usually results in the two ideas having similar implicature.  A metaphor is an isomorph.  The models that have been elicited with some degree of success in an isomorphic situation (some of them probably being isomorphic to the currently forming model itself due to the tight relationship between the environment and it’s representation) and that are in competition to activate a response to the current environmental situation vary across a number of factors making available alternative responses to any given environmental event.  Humans, along with some other species, have developed the ability to abstract themselves from their immediate environment and inspect the alternative models in order to make a decision about which alternative is most relevant in the current situation.  In order to do this they focus attention on different aspects of the alternative models.  Animals lower on the phylogenetic chain do not have this ability and their responses to the environment are entirely driven by emotional content, emotion being the sum total of their bodily feeling mediated by what in humans and other species with a neo cortex we would label the evolutionarily older brain.  At one time in our distant evolutionary past, humans engaged in the same behaviour but as we developed the neo cortex we developed the ability to inhibit immediate, intuitive, emotion driven responses.  However, the legacy of this earlier stage of evolution is that the most important factor implicit within a model that competes for a response is its emotional content.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Having now described a theoretical foundation I can return to the subject of trauma, to PTSD and the consequences of CSA.  Without experiencing trauma an individual makes their way through their environment, continuously constructing models that compete for a response activation and continuously inspecting those models with internalised attentional processes in order to allow one response and inhibit the others.  In this ‘normal’ individual, this process is fluid and uninterrupted.  In someone who has experienced trauma this process may be continuously interrupted.  The interruption begins when a model begins to be constructed that is isomorphic to the traumatic experience in any way, ie is similar to the traumatic event in any sensory modality.  This elicits the traumatic ‘memory’(the configuration of activated neurons) which, due to its high emotional content, invariably wins the competition to elicit a response.  Attention is then focused on the details of this model and due to it’s emotive content and traumatic association the individual’s internal attention is repetitively attracted to the details of this ‘memory’.  It is at this point that the individual is experiencing a flashback, the symptoms of which may differ between individuals.  Some may experience it more intensely than others, particularly if they experienced the trauma more recently than others.  Within  the same individual the effect of the process underlying flashbacks is variable, occasionally the traumatic memory may ‘win’ and be at the forefront of consciousness for minutes resulting in either a flashback or a fugue state or the individual may just find that they have difficulty concentrating.  The most significant effect of the process of PTSD is that attention is affected.  Because attention underlies many aspects of human functioning an attentional deficit of this kind affects the individual in many ways.  Of primary importance are social relationships, whether it be with work colleagues, parents, teachers or partners, these are affected by an attentional deficit.  The result of being unable to function at a ‘normal’ level within a social situation results in many secondary effects such as anxiety, lack of self esteem and depression.  At its worst the individual is continuously experiencing the intrusion of the traumatic memory, albeit at a sub conscious level and, unable to attend sufficiently to other processed mental models, is unable to inhibit violent responses to cases of extreme environmental pressure that would normally be inhibited.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">These serious negative consequences of PTSD occur for all individuals who experience PTSD to some extent.  However, individuals who have experienced ‘life-threatening’ events such as the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster or the recent Tsunami will differ not in terms of the severity of the disorder but in terms of the phenomenal experience of the symptoms.  An adult who experienced CSA when a youngster will continue to flashback at times but will not have conscious recollection of the memories and so will not be able to explain why they disappear into a fugue state from time to time.  What will be noticeable when they do though is that they will often seem distracted and distant and their eyes will move rapidly from side to side.  The reason that their eyes move is that the eye muscles are affected by the internal attentional processes that are in a feedback loop, continuously inspecting the same details of the traumatic memory over and over again for the duration of the flashback.  The eye movements are vestigial being left over from a time in our earlier evolutionary past before we had developed the ability to internalise attention and create an abstraction of the environment.  Due to the fact that the continuously inspected attentional process requires the neuronal complex that once had a tight binding between environmental response and visual perception of the environment, the neurons underlying the ocular response, which are vestigial in humans with regards to some immediate response to external stimuli, are still employed.  It is for this reason that in individuals with PTSD, their eyes most often have bags under them, as the same venal system is employed in some way.  This gives rise to the characteristic look that many men who experience PTSD have with bags under their eyes, and a reputation for violence, as the extreme cognitive load that they are under due to the continuous nature of the attentional system as it processes and inspects the environment for stimuli that might be threatening to them leads to irritability and combined with lack of sleep leads to a situation where the individual is at once primed to respond violently to the environment and does not have the cognitive resources available to inhibit the response that is made and who then rationalises their behaviour as part of their character in line with the expected stereotype that they are handed as part of the myth of the society that they live in.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Beyond the cognitive consequences, a child who experiences trauma, particularly a trauma that can not be discussed freely such as CSA, will ‘learn to live’ with the symptoms.  Very much like dyslexic children who develop strategies to get through school without being able to read, an individual who experiences PTSD as a consequence of CSA will find ways of existing with the secondary consequences i.e. the negative social consequences, the anxiety, the inability to concentrate and, in some, violent outbursts of temper.  Very often, children who develop PTSD are the class clowns,  developing the strategy as a way of rationalising their situation and circumnavigating the consequences of their inability to concentrate.  Due to the hormones underlying reproductive behaviour mediating in the ability to concentrate, humans establish a situation cognitively where rule based existence becomes more matter of fact as the individual is better able to inspect (pay attention to) the internal details of the mental model that they employ in any given situation (one can see the existence of this in the fact that testosterone fuelled individuals make better sportsmen as they are better able to survive in situations that demand a great ability to concentrate whilst moving) at the onset of puberty.  Due to the fact that breaches of trust between caregiver and child often happen before the child has reached puberty, at the onset of puberty when an adult moral framework is established, children suddenly find themselves in a situation where any breach of trust that occurred or continues to occur are most negatively impacted as they attempt to integrate what is happening to them into this new adult moral framework.  It is the cognitive dissonance that occurs due to the difficulty of integrating this information that leads to situations whereby children suddenly begin to read less, behave worse, withdraw socially etc at the onset of puberty.  In my experience, individuals who experience a breach of trust that is difficult to integrate and that induces PTSD who have experienced that breach of trust concurrent with the onset of puberty or slightly afterwards are at the greatest  danger of being unable to integrate what has happened to them in such a way as to adopt strategies that lead to success in terms of dealing with their situation.    Matters are complicated even further by tertiary consequences in that  individuals, not willing to discuss their particular experience of trauma or not even realising that it is the trauma that is responsible, are given negative labels that are in themselves self fulfilling prophecies.  In my view, one of the most debilitating consequences of CSA related PTSD is that the attentional deficit prevents a consistent persona being projected during social interaction.  Either an individual is unable to provide the correct non verbal cues to accompany a linguistic utterance or the attentional deficit leads to an imperceptible delay in responding that affects the interpretation leading to the individual being perceived as ingenuous and deceitful.  Trust, operationally defined, is the ability to relax in the company of another due to the ability to successfully predict the outcomes of the interactions that occur with that other person.  Individuals in an in-group are more likely to trust one another as they tend to display behavioural stereotypy that is consistent with that group norm.  The individual with PTSD in that situation however, has an almost imperceptible time lag (sometimes being faster and sometimes being slower) due to the frequent re-occurrence of the cognitive load that PTSD induces as the different environments that the individuals are in when interacting lead to metaphorical cues that sometimes elicit the PTSD and sometimes do not.   This means that others are at a deficit when predicting successfully the interactions that they have with the individual with PTSD, leading to cognitive dissonance, albeit a small amount at first, the labelling of the feeling of cognitive dissonance often grows to the extent that the individual with PTSD is often labelled in such a way as to promote their ejection from their in-group depending on the strategy that they adopt.  Amongst other tertiary consequences, such as the contempt that individuals who grow up with CSA related PTSD generate for their seemingly ‘ingenuous’ behaviour, lie the instances of self harm including drug abuse that seem to affect so many individuals.  Perhaps the worst tertiary consequence relates to the label given to individuals who speak out about their trauma.  Not realising the existence of PTSD, many mental health professionals subscribe to aetiological models of the symptoms associated with CSA that leads them to label sufferers with far worse labels that are just as replete with the possibility of leading to a self fulfilling prophecy.  The wavering of attention that may be slight at first and exaggerated as PTSD is sublimated often leads to mental health issues, with the majority of mental health issues having an underlying attentional component, most likely due to an earlier breach of trust.  In the most if not all cases of mental health issues that I have witnessed personally, the mental health issue, where it can be attributed especially to some pathological underlying physiological condition, always demonstrates itself in a way that is symptomatic of an underlying imbalance in attentional resource allocation.  Attention is either too concentrated, in which cases the individual has become focused on one particular aspect of their environment or attention cannot be focused at all and is continually wavering in a way that is pathological.  One must keep in mind at this point that a healthy ability to attend to the external environment is necessary to exist socially, that trust, as I define it, is mediated by attentional resource allocation and that in order to function successfully as a social animal, human attention must be divided between an enormous amounts of competing information with regards to social interaction with others.  Where the cognitive load on the attentional subsystem is continuously high, those individuals are at a deficit in comparison to others where social interaction is necessary.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Modern anti-psychotic pharmaceuticals that are applied to individuals experiencing symptoms of mental health issues do little more than disturb the attentional pattern of the individual, some quite violently.  Their action of effect playing quite obviously on the neurons responsible for underlying muscle response in a blanket approach due to the inability of current anti psychotic medications to target the areas responsible for the 'illness' that the individual experiences leads to many undesirable consequences for the individual that follows a regime of anti-psychotic medication, such as tardive diskynesia and other extra pyramidal side effects that mean that the individual often experiences a worse quality of life when taking the medication.  Furthermore, the importance of their own internal attentional pattern for their own coherent sense of self, means that many patients on regimes of anti-psychotic medication lose their personality completely, often forgetting who they were before they began the courses of medication such that they are never able to objectively assess whether they have improved, as in forgetting the person that they were, they have no standard by which to compare whether or not they are healthy.  This occurs, I suspect, as the medication regime not only interrupts their attentional pattern, but then holds it in a new 'position' and the central nervous system then adapts, relatively rapidly, to that novel environment that is comprised by maintaining that 'position', with the majority of patients that I have witnessed 'forgetting' who they are within three months of medication, such that they are never realistically capable of arguing that they would be better off a medication regime.  The medication regime, keeping in mind that the mechanism of medication is poorly understood, having been arrived at as a 'cure' largely through a combination of the observation of effects, spurious theorising, and efficiency, is like a strong 'meme' in some sense, in that the individuals who experience it are unable to defend themselves against it, not being able to perceive how negatively it has impacted on their ability to function as they cannot recall themselves before the regime began.  Added to this the fact that a supposed authority figure, the psychiatrist, is prescribing this, along with the fact that they are often unable to convince their guardians against the overwhelming authority figure that psychiatric opinion provides (much of which is largely a nonsense).</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Individuals who experience the symptoms of PTSD as children, may not do so solely because of CSA.  Many different forms of trauma can lead to the symptoms of sublimated PTSD occurring later on in childhood.  This can actually provide a boon for the therapist, who no longer has to engage in the 'talking cure' and elicit the case history of the individual at a time when relating that history undoubtedly induces the PTSD related symptoms as the history is discussed, waking up the memory and thus the PTSD.  Instead the therapist can describe the possible aetiological circumstances that might lead to PTSD such as a breach of trust between the child and a caregiver so that the client can decide whether they have indeed experienced a breach of trust that might lead to PTSD, and then the therapist can engage in Systematic Eye Desensitisation (also known as EMDR – eye movement desensitisation and reprogramming) without the client ever having to discuss their case history.  This is important as the client can then, when relieved of the symptoms of PTSD, decide whether it is necessary to discuss the situation that lead to the PTSD inducing trauma.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Most of the primary symptoms of PTSD in individuals who experienced CSA when younger were described above when discussing the DSM.  As mentioned above there are symptoms associated with CSA related PTSD that are not mentioned in the DSM.  One consequence that I have noticed that many individuals experience is significant weight gain at around the age of eleven with others experiencing a seriously excessive addiction to chocolate throughout their teenage years.  These may seem inconsequential, unattributable to CSA related PTSD but I believe that due to the attentional deficit underlying PTSD, many individuals experience what could be characterised as a high ‘cognitive load’ in trying to maintain the same level of social and cognitive functioning as their peers and that the brain’s requirements, which I believe uses as much as 80 per cent of daily energy intake, consequently increase.  Another consequence that I feel may relate to the same underlying cause is that an individual may experience great difficulty in being able to use abstraction to the same degree as their peers resulting in great difficulty in performing well at subjects such as mathematics and science that employ abstraction to a great degree.  Metaphorical reasoning may be impossible.  The consequences of PTSD related CSA are multiple and wide ranging and are best interpreted as lying within a spectrum of consequences as some individuals are more affected than others and not every individual experiences the same spectrum of symptoms.  However, underlying all of the consequences is the attentional deficit as described above and if you ‘cure’ the PTSD then the primary symptom of the attentional deficit should disappear, the secondary symptoms such as anxiety and depression will be abated and might disappear altogether, although the tertiary consequences, particularly other people’s perceptions of the individual are harder to deal with.  This is why it is necessary to address the possibility of the existence of PTSD at an early age, the earlier the better.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">A plausible ‘cure’ for CSA related PTSD as for PTSD caused by other situations can be found in a therapeutic approach called Systematic Eye Desensitisation(SED) also called Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprogramming(EMDR).  This is a therapy mentioned above that I experienced whilst living in Plymouth.  The practitioner’s name was Alan Hassard, a clinical psychologist working at Derriford Hospital who researches and publishes on the subject of SED (Hassard, A.(1993), Hassard, A.(1996)).  SED is a non intrusive and inexpensive form of therapy that is provided across a series of encounters between practitioner and client first introduced by Shapiro(1989).  As mentioned above, there is considerable theoretical resistance to SED but I believe that the results reported by Alan Hassard amongst others are that the efficacy for different types of trauma is very high and its usage amongst counsellors, particularly in the USA is on the increase.  The most common method of SED is to ask the client to visualise the traumatic event, focusing on one memory or ‘image’ of the trauma whilst keeping the eyes open.  The client is then asked to focus attention on a point, in my case a coin attached to a stick, which is then moved from side to side within the client’s visual field by the practitioner.  The focus of attention is moved from side to side, as far as I remember, about sixteen times before the client may relax.  This process is repeated about eight or nine times with a variety of commonly re-experienced traumatic memories during which the client may experience a ‘loss’ of the memory.  I experienced this process phenomenally as though the memories ‘floated’ off; they became less vivid and eventually I found myself unable to re-establish the memories with the ease that I had done before the therapy began.  The memories were still in existence but they were less emotionally laden and less prone to inducing a negative emotional state when recalled.  Within six months of treatment, it became noticeable that I was less inclined to depression and other symptoms that I still attribute to having had the misfortune of experiencing CSA that I had experienced before the treatment began  Other methods of SED employ different forms of distracting attention, where visual focus is not appropriate for instance, earphones are given to the patient and an audible click occurs, alternating between the two ears.  Another form of distraction is for the client to wear a wristband with a device that applies pressure to a point on the client’s forearm at intervals.  It is my current understanding, although not with the benefit of clinical trials, that in order to maximise the successful outcome of a SED intervention, the attentional process of any individual who is to receive the treatment must be as free from interference as possible, so anti-psychotic medication, alcohol and other influences that negatively impact attentional process must be withdrawn prior to SED beginning.  Furthermore, I suspect that a consistent pattern of attentional inspection of external information sources is necessary to induce for SED to be most effective.  Currently, I suspect, many individuals have developed attentional processes from gathering the majority of their information from the television, in contrast to books, that are different from those who read regularly.  I would advocate either training in a consistent pattern of attentional inspection such as slow eye movement reading before SED begins or to further study patterns of attentional inspection between individuals with differing styles of attention.  The majority of first year university students who are the traditional subjects in many academic studies will all have an ability to gather information in a similar way, in contrast to those who do not read regularly, especially where that reading is not targeted at gathering information in terms of the comprehension of an underlying logic to the text. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	Underlying the efficacy of SED is, I believe, a process of breaking the feedback loop that intrusive, traumatically established mental models incur.  This is accomplished by providing a competing and stronger form of attentional process than is employed by the traumatic feedback process that is incompatible with the PTSD response.  Essentially, the process of SED prevents other mental models that compete for response generation in any situation, where those mental models are elicited by their isomorphic similarity to the external or internal environment (the sum of all internal events – emotional states, cognitive stimuli, memories etc) that the individual experienced at the time of the trauma, from isomorphically ‘awakening’ the traumatic memory.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It must be remembered that traumatic memory and post traumatic processes are a normal part of our daily cognitive operation.  As we flow through our environment (one must keep in mind that we are continuous with our environment in some sense – there is no situation where I can locate a percept in our central nervous system in any static, discrete manner where it continuously exists in that state), our attentional process is continuously inspecting the environment for sources of danger to ourselves.  This is a process that is necessary to our survival and where it fails, we may damage ourselves.  In situations where it does fail, the immediate shock to our state of physical being is such a strong stimulus that the internal bodily state at the point of the trauma becomes a memory of that event.  When navigating the same environment, or any other environment that is isomorphically similar, our attentional processes inspect either visually or in some other way, the location in our environment where the trauma existed, in order to circumnavigate the area successfully without experiencing that trauma.  For example, imagine that as I walk across my bedroom, I stub my toe.  When I next walk across my bedroom, as I approach the point at which I stubbed my toe, my attentional process inspects the area and I move around the offending area.  In general, I avoid the area where I stubbed my toe from then on.  The fact of the manner in which this process operates can explain why it is that some people experience accidents that are almost repeats of their previous accidents.  I am thinking particularly of motorbike accidents, where an individual may have experienced an accident, and then experiences an environment that is metaphorically similar to the environment in which that accident occurred, most likely at a time when their existence depends on a cognitive load that hinges upon good balance.  The sudden automatic requirement to inspect an aspect of the environment that may or may not be relevant to the rider at that time and the consequent deleterious effect on the balance of the rider due to the fact that that neuronal complex underlying that attentional resource is shared vestigially with the ocular-motor system and competes for the resources therein leads to a further accident.  Systematic Eye Desensitisation following an accident should alleviate the potential for the occurrence of repeat accidents.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I would suggest that trauma plays an important part in our normal everyday existence and should be dissociated as a referent term from only implying negative consequences to a broader application where trauma is considered as any situation that impacts on the cognitive process of the individual in such a way as to induce cognitive dissonance sufficient for any similar environment in the isomorphic sense that co-existed with the occurrence of that trauma to re-establish that resultant cognitive process.  One might find then that at the most fine grained resolution, trauma is simply the establishment of memory.  One could then further narrow that definition even as far as suggesting that a sharp discrepancy between two individual groups of neurons, at the retina for example, might be capable of being considered under the same rubric that this definition of trauma provides.    </p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-size:18.666668px">This appendix illustrates the type of hand out that I might give to a prospective patient where EMDR is recommended.  I hope to find a clear and plain type of language that can be understood easily by an English speaker with any educational or socio-economic background.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-weight:bold">PTSD and EMDR</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There is a definition of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) that is more inclusive than the definition that is sometimes discussed, which is where, as a condition, it accompanies or follows loud explosions or witnessing death, or the death of a loved one.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The more inclusive definition includes any shocking event, where that event stands out from the background, and psychologically, can include many different causes, ranging from childhood sexual abuse, to isolation, to physical abuse, or any other frightening experience or repeated experience, such as experience of being bullied.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In each case, what is implied, is that there is a neural complex in the brain, that is left over from that traumatic experience, and that when you are passing through an environment that is similar to the one in which the original environment occurred, this can stimulate the re-energising of that leftover neural complex.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What happens then, is that the neural complex involves looking out for a source of danger, and, not finding it to be present, continues looking.  As it does so, it consumes attentional resources.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The consumption of the available attentional resources can leave a person experiencing many different psychological consequences, ranging from depression to disassociation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:&apos;Nimbus Roman No9 L&apos;,serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">EMDR seeks to undo that traumatically created neural complex, so that when the person is passing through some environment that would ‘trigger’ the neural complex to start taking up more than its fair share of resources, the environment no longer triggers the neural complex.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">It does this by presenting an attention grabbing stimulus, which is waved backwards and forwards in front of the patient, by the practitioner.  The patient holds their head still, and follows the stimulus with their eyes, whilst at the same time bringing to mind, a visual memory of the traumatic event.  The imagination or memory, is the most powerful of environments that can trigger the neural complex, and so the moving of one’s eyes whilst recalling, creates an attentional process that is stronger and, importantly, within the willed grasp of the patient.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What happens following EMDR is that the patient will enter into some environment that triggers the neural complex formation, but the memory of moving the eyes during the EMDR is a stronger attentional bias than the neural complex, which is no longer formed.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Following EMDR, because the trauma is no longer being ‘woken up’, patients experience less adrenal stress, as the adrenals are required to ‘push’ resources to the brain, and with less stress, comes less depression, and social facilitation with greater ease, amongst other positive impacts.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-weight:bold">Alcoholism</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I hypothesise that alcoholism is a traumatic experience sufficient to create itself, and may be addressable through the use of EMDR.  If you have ever witnessed alcoholism, then you will know that it is often a series of traumatic incidents.  I would go further and state that alcoholism is caused by having an existing trauma.  The existing trauma leaves a self perpetuating neural complex occurring in the brain that ‘eats up’ resources, often consuming so much of them that adrenal exhaustion leaves the person as a depressive or with other minor mental health conditions.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The brain is an efficient shepherd.  When it tastes alcohol, it tastes a material that it knows will deliver large amounts of fat and sugar to the neural complex that needs it, and that because it thins the blood, it will deliver that fat and sugar more efficiently if it uses alcohol, than any other substance.  The brain then chooses alcohol, often more powerfully than the person is able to resist.  At its worst, this leaves the person subject to the brain’s demands to the extent that eating a healthy diet is exchanged purely for alcohol, and damage to the body ensues.  When this occurs, the person rationalises their behaviour.  The process of rationalisation is more commonly known as ‘making excuses’.  So the person makes excuses for their behaviour, but the behaviour is largely automatic.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, how might EMDR cure this?   Well, I hypothesise that traumas are additive.  One often hears the phrase ‘traumas occur in threes’.   This is because, I suspect, the brain, for efficiency, stores similar experiences using the same neural complexes, and traumas are isomorphically the same (structurally the same at a metaphorical level).</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, when entering the environment of alcohol, the traumatic memories associated with alcoholism are awoken, to the extent that the brain takes over and behaviour becomes automatically ‘steered’ towards obtaining alcohol, with the person’s conscious mind making excuses, although rationalisations is a less loaded word for those self explanatory verbalisations.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">If one can use EMDR to return endogenous control to the alcoholic then they should be able to have a greater amount of self control when faced with the drive to find and use alcohol.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Mitigating against the success of this technique, is the fact that many alcoholics are experiencing, with their alcoholism, a secondary addiction that they have acquired due to their use of harder drugs, such as heroin or cocaine, which they have taken at the same time as alcohol, at some point.  Hopefully, understanding that the brain can ‘take control’ and steer the person beyond their own freewill, when it finds a substance that it considers to be more efficient, should empower the alcoholic person to recognise their condition more powerfully.  EMDR will hopefully help to some extent, such that the person can engage in alcohol consumption without becoming prey to the cravings.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">This is a different approach to complete abstinence, as suggested by the AA, which is preferred since with abstinence, an important part of socialising of the individual can be lost.   Lacking the ability to socialise healthily, stress builds up with in their life, and then the brain chooses to abuse alcohol for its capacity to meet the demands of the stressed brain, by feeding it sugars and fat quickly by thinning the blood to allow it to get there.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">I have mentioned, at various points in this book, that I am being subjected to a criminal act by some thieves.  These thieves use a lot of techniques that could be referred to at a level of description that could be described as materialist psychology.  I include this appendix, which is of some length, for the sake of  hopefully encouraging other victims to recognise that they have been attacked, and to speak out.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	I also include this appendix, by way of a call for help, to alert the authorities, since I am not the only victim; there are many others.  We are mostly academics, after a fashion, since we have been students at university, undertaking a first degree, and have found ourselves being attacked in our final year, to ensure our failure, in a manner that leaves us studying for the ultimate benefit of some thieves who interrogate us in a particular way, a few years later, to capture the essence of our insights and any discoveries that we might have made.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The thieves are not simply thieves, I simply refer to them using that term to concentrate on their ultimate cause, rather than get lost in the myriad of different aspects that they present.  They, ultimately, are some <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">organised criminals</span> who have been associated with merchant traders of the Indian sub-continent, for at least two thousand years, and most likely, far more.  I have traced the history of their existence by tracing the existence of their techniques and general modus operandi through history and it does go back much further.   However, I will most likely leave the historical information for a later book on the subject.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">What I want to do here, in this appendix, is provide some information about their techniques and technologies, in order to illustrate the type of crime that they are engaging in, with a hope that some further investigation, might be stimulated.  Furthermore, I hope that in illustrating the existence of this crime, the universities of affected countries, will be able to take action to remedy the situation, and defend their students from these crimes.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	The victims of the crimes of the thieves, can be divided into several groups based upon whether or not they have been lined up to be on the receiving end of the criminal act at an earlier age.  In some cases, students are identified, for the first time as having that type of value that the thieves want to exploit, whilst at university.  In other cases, including mine, the thieves have started on their victim much earlier.  As far as I am aware at the moment, the latter category of victims are those who are the near relatives of British aristocracy.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">There are political reasons for this, as the thieves are attempting to oversee a change of psychological culture of Britain, from post Protestant, to Catholic or similar.  The religious nomenclature is not necessary, as it is less about Roman rule of one kind or another, and more about motivating the British people away from their long belief in redemption and empathy, the ‘there but for the grace of God go I’ philosophy that results in societal structural integrity, evidenced by the existence of the NHS and National Insurance, and towards some accepted axiomatic principle to life that enshrines a fixed destiny, a genetic, or other, determinism, and the rigid class, or caste system, and station in life that follows, as well as the acceptance of slavery – birth into an unchanging role; that destiny.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The reason for this is that they want us in Britain, to have a system of belief that will influence our early development as individuals, and that will then render us more susceptible to hypnosis in later life.  The thieves have been using hypnosis as their primary tool, for many millennia, a fact that I can potentially support with evidence.   </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Their general attack on society involves being present as an agency as a society transitions from an agricultural society to an industrialised society.  This transition is something that the thieves institute, employing their experience in doing so and their position at the centre of the trade routes, to allow them to control the later destruction of that society.  If this all sounds like a conspiracy theory, then I would understand, but the historical evidence, some of which I will describe later, supports the observation.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">One of the reasons that these thieves have continued unabated, is the fact that they employ only a few strategies, but strategies that are powerful.  The first is that they make their crimes unspeakable, either through making them so complex that they cannot be described easily, or so utterly smutty and disgusting that it is virtually impossible to bring the subject to mind, let alone discuss it with others.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">In the case of the crime being complex, the criminal act is made out of a number of parts, each contingent on the other, and there are more parts than can be easily held in working memory.  When the victim tries to describe what is happening, the jumbled statements of their unfamiliarity with the description of complex logic, leave them in a state where they look to be suffering from ‘stress’ or some mental health issue.  The thieves have deeply implicated themselves in the construction and practice of the modern mental health system, and have a great level of control over the victim, once the victim has been placed within that categorical frame of reference, of mental health issues.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">There is a third technique, and probably others will come to mind as I type, since I have been ‘studying’ this situation, on the receiving end of it, for the last twenty years.  That third technique is to use praxis based communication.  This type of communication involves using information to describe the subject or object of the sentence, or both, in terms that are metaphorical, in a way that is known only to the speaker and the hearer.  The use of praxis based communication ensures that some intimidating threat can be levied against the victim in a way that the victim finds entirely difficult to describe, in general not having access to the knowledge of the term ‘praxis based communication’ and what it implies.  Since this praxis based threat technique is used by the thieves and bullies of all other sorts as well, it would be a sage idea to introduce the term ‘praxis based communication’ to students during their general education.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The use of praxis based communication can be taken to an art form, and to a point where it is so intimidating that it frightens the victim.  Sometimes augmented with cannabis laced with opiates or similar, praxis based communication can be used to scare a victim into accepting some ‘threat’ without there ever really being any evidence of such a threat present.  The skilled intimidator will read the reactions of the victim as, when threatened, fears that the victim has, will ‘surface’ and be present in their attempt at dialogue under stress.  The intimidator then encourages the victim into accepting that frightening reality, which the victim will do because their own persecution complex, in which a saviour only arrives when there is a visible threat, lures them in to accepting some imagined threat, despite the lack of evidence.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The thieves have been targeting me for most of my life.  I was molested when younger, exposed to CSA (child sexual abuse), for most of my childhood and early teens.  Having threatened to kill my parents, when he first approached me, at the age of 4, I had spent that time when molested, going into a temporary fugue state, present only in body, as the molester moved me into position, and satisfied himself.  The molestation was most likely to surrender me into a state where I would be susceptible later.  During my early childhood and youth generally, props were planted into my environment to make sure that there would seem to be convincing ‘evidence’, sufficiently real to convince me of some end or other, when in the room later on, being interrogated.  The thieves have the child molested, as this intellectualises the child.  The child is unable to <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">engage in</span> normal mimetic associative learning, and instead, forms a continuous sotto voce narrative, modelling the processes that are occurring during mimetic learning, introspecting on a process, the sotto voce narrative of which is probably occurring in the sub conscious of every one of his or her peers.  The state of fight/flight that the child experiences, particularly in the educational arena of the classroom, where an adult enters the room and effectively ‘inserts’ things in to them, in this case knowledge, leaves the child hearing the sotto voce narrative.  Because of the isomorphy between the abuser and the teacher, the child doesn’t present as a good student at school, experiencing attentional deficit induced behaviours that are generally disruptive.  This leaves the child less likely to be spotted in terms of their developing intellect.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The criminals are organised, and are attacking our families in Britain in several related ways.  The most obvious manner is the way in which they infiltrate lawyers offices, to obtain details of wills, and, informed by this, they attack a family where the children are likely to inherit a large amount of money or property, and attack the siblings making certain that there is only one left who will inherit.  The others are either dead, perhaps from suicide or drug overdose, or disinherited through differences between the parents and children that are raised artificially using hypnosis and conditioning techniques.   The bulk of the inheritance is then funnelled into the hands of one sibling, who is then attacked or married, before dying, and the criminals obtain as much of the inheritance as they can manage. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The criminals are organised in a way that sees them making the most of each opportunity.  So, the attack in any way which maximises their income from the victim.  For example, in situations where the child comes from a long line of educated people, such as the aristocracy, once the family is far enough away from direct contact with aristocracy, socially, the children are attacked.  This is when the CSA intellectualises the child, such that the thieves can later attack that child, who will have experienced social drift, due to their initial station, and the attentional deficit and its effects that is raised by the CSA.  They are then interrogated for their observations about their friends and family, so that the thieves can obtain more knowledge about the local community.  They are particularly after any information about local peers of the victim where that information references some childhood experience.  If they know these experiences, then they can use them when hypnotising the discussed individuals.  During that interrogation, any intellectual potentially patentable information is extracted from the victim, who is then discarded having been driven mad during the interrogation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The interrogation follows a lengthy period of being prepared for that interrogation, physically, psychologically and emotionally, as I will discuss later.  In preparation for that interrogation, props are planted to be used when the victim is in their bedsit being interrogated.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">One of these ‘</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">props’</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">, involved my mother having some rather rare and beautiful Victorian glass marbles, which I got my hands on, and then took to my primary school, Victoria College Prep.  I then preceded to lose my marbles.  This event was deliberate on the part of the thieving hypnotists who knew at that time that I would be spending time in my bedsit much later, being interrogated.  They hoped to talk me into believing in a model of immortality into which they would incorporate the idea of a fixed and unchanging destiny, a technique for encouraging the susceptibility to hypnosis of the adepts of that religion.  Working through the logic of the suggestion of immortality, at least from my perspective, my understanding, though, I could not find any hint even of destiny.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Another time, when I was a teenager, my closest friend arrived at my house and encouraged me to go with him to the woods across the field at the back of my house, to a wood, that is below the house of some elderly neighbours who are old enough to have witnessed the second world war, and who are originally from Austria.  My friend, when we got to the woods, tied up the body of a dead rabbit, and we both beat it with sticks, aggressively.  The event was later used during the interrogation, in an attempt to encourage me to believe, in the flat, that we were experiencing the consequences of genetic memory and that we were descended from Nazi sympathisers, and that I was being punished by Mossad.  It was a deliberate ‘prop’ placed in my life for the sake of the later interrogation. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The allegation that my family might be Nazi sympathisers, is abhorrent to me.  My great uncle’s father was tied to a post to be shot by the Nazis for his defence of the islanders, and my grandfather was a squadron leader who flew Hurricanes against the Germans in the war.  There have been no Nazi sympathisers in my family.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Also, the ‘Jersey Steel Company’ is a stone’s throw away from my family home, and my friend used to turn to me when the sound of the press was going, and since we never saw any work going on there he and I would joke about the sounds ‘being on’ in Jersey steel.  This was later used to suggest, during the interrogation, that my friend was ‘communicating’ to me </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">in advance,</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal"> suggesting he knew in some way about the sub conscious auditory stimuli used in ‘Jersey steal’.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">My friends and I used teenage throwaway phrases, one of which was to pause, put a hand behind an ear, and say, to emphasize how ridiculous some statement was, ‘listen, my nipples have gone hard’, which is, I think, some reference from a tv show or similar.  By the time of my interrogation, it was used to suggest that they were encouraging me to believe that I was under observation by some friendly agency from the point at which I had experienced mastitis at puberty.  The phrase, though, was undoubtedly hypnotically conditioned into my friends and I, for the sake of encouraging the later suggestion that was exploited when I was being interrogated.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">The thieves ‘set the scene’ by making sure that my brother was standing too close when I swung a golf club.  We had both been conditioned to react off one another. He repeatedly stated that he was too close, and I eventually accepted and swang the golf club, leaving his accompanying friends with cases of PTSD, and my brother with damage to his forehead.  <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">It was something of a miracle that my brother lived, but as he got older, the traumatic consequence of the incident meant that any time he was presented with the idea of company in the form of friends, his re-experience of that event would occur traumatically, and he would steer away from it, which left him isolated and alone.   Much later, when I was being attacked more openly, the incident was used to motivate people against me.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The thieves use as tools any group of people who use ‘secret’ techniques.   These groups include the national front, feminist organisations, religious groups, essentially any group that will do something where the victim will not be informed openly as to the reason for the cause.  This allows the thieves to leave the victim believing in whatever the thieves want them to believe.  The thieves ask the victim what he or she believes to be the cause, and as long as that belief works in the favour of the criminals, the thieves then reinforce that belief.  The victim is then left ascribing some cause or other for the attacks that he or she receives.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The man who molested me presented himself as a radically evangelical Christian, which, I suspect allowed the thieves to guarantee that I would be able to be pushed towards a negative assessment of Christianity, which I did during the interrogation, in order to distance support for me from the community.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Throughout the early part of the interrogation, as I was experiencing the part of the adrenal profile that pushed me towards some romantic belief system, I was regularly forced to repeat the phrase ‘can you cure cancer’.  This phrase didn’t subside until I had started to provide some guessed model of how cancer might be working, which, in my case, was by incorrect delivery of stem cells, due to biased cardiovascular hydraulics.  Not until much later, and quite recently in the history of my writing of this book, did I do some reading and realise that stem cells are not distributed by the cardiovascular system, but are present in the place where they operate.  I’m relatively certain that the incorrect model of the cause of cancer that I was encouraged to create, is part of a technique to discredit everything that I have written.  The victim is interrogated of their insights, and a false idea is deliberately planted, such that when a reader reads the victim’s book, they reach the obviously nonsensical idea, and then discard all of the insights, not just the obviously incorrect notion.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">During the interrogation, whilst I was experiencing the psychological consequences of the unblocked liver, the thieves tried to build a sotto-voce narrative where I would come to trust without question, that ‘voice’, that sotto-voce identity. A long, drawn out battle of wits took place over the course of several years in which I made an effort to make certain that I made a correct attribution of cause.  The thieves use a form of hypnotic conditioning, in which, at some distance from the victim, they can, through understanding the predictive nature of cognition, create a narrative in the mind of the victim.  If I had to try and recreate the effect in a laboratory, I might start by creating a traumatic cycle in the mind of the subject, and then, knowing the repeating mantra that should be occurring, I then insinuate myself into the subject’s sotto-voce, by delibidinising them slightly, as I occupy the subconscious auditory channel, and repeat the mantra until the subject has given way and counts the externally created thought process as internal.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This use of an externally created sotto-voce is made virtually impossible to describe because psychiatry has been deliberately designed to prevent any victim from successfully describing what the thieves do.  Even as I write these paragraphs, I am reasonably terrified that a psychiatrist will diagnose ‘thought implantation’ or recognise ‘hearing voices’ etc. and will then take me off the less painful medication and put me on the more painful medication.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">One of the groups of individuals who will engage in secretive activity against the victim is vigilantes.  These individuals have been raised up in the name of the defence of children.  They are not that style of vigilante that practises entrapment, as popularised by Cheyenne O’Connor, locally, in Jersey.  Instead they identify what they consider to be potential abusers, they profile, and then delibidinise the individual in order to diminish their likelihood of sexual or otherwise aggression.  This is based in a belief that testosterone is the cause of aggression, but this is an incorrect belief. If I take testosterone supplements by mouth, then the sudden introduction of testosterone, will leave my cardiovascular resources moving more swiftly than I can control, and the resulting condition may resemble aggression.  However, if I allow myself to accommodate to testosterone supplements or I use an osmosing gel or patches, then I will not get aggressive.  In fact, quite the opposite is true.  When a person lacks testosterone, they experience a greater inability to meet the demands of endogenous control of attention.  In other words, </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">they are </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">more likely to become susceptible to the influence of exogenous cues, which includes hypnotic biases.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">When I first told a girlfriend, at the age of 17, to prevent her blaming herself for our sexual problems (I could not ejaculate), I found the trauma of disclosure created a traumatic cycle, leaving me catharcising the act of disclosure, again and again, rationalising it as ‘the talking cure’.  <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">One day, I was driving myself and my friends up to the north coast of the island to go for a beer, when I suddenly broke down, sobbing.  That was a consequence of the adjustment of my testosterone levels.   I had been delibidinised, by vigilantes.  As my testosterone levels were reduced, my appetite for sex with my girlfriend became seemingly insatiable.  I was unable to resist the exogenous cue that she presented to me, as my endogenous control was lowered due to my testosterone being lowered.   Also, as I was delibinised, I would find myself engaging in what looked like aggressive tantrums, a consequence of reduced endogenous control.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">This left vigilantes undoubtedly feeling certain that they had engaged in the right course of action, a false positive identification with terrible consequences for myself, and any other victim.  The vigilantes are most likely the cause of many paedophiles, as they often expose the victim to a false allegation, to see how they respond.  The victim, traumatised by this allegation, then eventually catharcises the stress of this overbearing traumatic complex as the disgusting behaviour.   Effectively, it is more true to state that ‘the accused abuse’ than ‘the abused abuse’.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">As the vigilantes continued to delibidinise me, throughout my twenties, I experienced pretty much the whole range of mental health issues, from clinical depression to an idiopathic version of dissociative identity disorder, so depressed that I did not recognise myself in the mirror.  If I had been placed in front of the mental health services, I would never have seen the light of day again, in a manner of speaking, since I would have been medicated for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">When I was 26, I had been going out with a woman and had moved in with her and her daughter, into a flat that I rented for us.  I decided that it was long overdue that I should go to the police about the man who molested me.  The abuse had ended when I was a teenager, but I hadn’t yet reported it.  The man who molested me had threatened my parents when he first began, and I had, at that time, decided to go to the police, eventually.  When I was 21, I went travelling to Thailand and Indonesia with a friend, and I had decided to go to the police, when I returned, but I put it off.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">So, I went to the police, gave a statement, and they asked me to meet the molester whilst wearing a wire.  I did so, in a local park, but was given very little in the way of instruction by the police, with the exception of being instructed to not ask leading questions.  It was a poorly rehearsed and executed idea, and technological problems meant the resulting evidence was not utilised as evidence.  That was when my problems began, more visibly than they had.  Until then, I had experienced all sorts of mental health issues, consequent to being repeatedly delibidinised by vigilantes, but there had been no open threats or visibly bad feeling.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">And then, I was at a friend’s flat, sitting the flat for him, whilst he was away, when watching the program, ‘NYPD blue’.  The Hispanic lead actor turned to the camera and said ‘of course, the abused abuse’.  This followed me being approached by a thief at work, who stole some merchandise from where I was working, and then, later that same day, in the employees’ cafe, being approached by a very large, stockily built individual who, in one of the first ‘praxis based’ communications that I had been on the receiving end of, leered at me with bulging eyes as he recounted how he had been paid to beat up a man who had molested children.  I had, not long before that, perhaps a week before, met with the man who had molested me, wired up for sound, in a local park, at the request of the investigating police, who I had approached, regarding the man.  The stocky man had gone to school with my brother, and I suspect that he may have had a grudge related to the golf club incident.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I had also started studying for an A level in psychology, which I then used to obtain a place at Plymouth university, in order to obtain a degree, so that I could get better employment in Jersey, for the sake of buying a house for my girlfriend and her/our daughter.  So, as I was seeing the police about the statement, they asked me to attend meetings with a psychiatrist, Jim Hollywood.  I found myself, one day, sitting with my girlfriend’s daughter on my lap, when I started thinking about marrying her mother, and started to get an erection.  At the time, I had been getting an erection in unusual places generally, and quite regularly, although I failed to mention this to the psychiatrist.  I went to him and told him that I had had an erection, which may be something that caused what followed.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">However, the most likely reason for the erection is that I was being conditioned by the Indian guy downstairs.  As I describe later, many of the Indian thieves have names that can be interpreted in many different ways in English.  This guy was no different, his name being Hans Singh.  All the victims of CSA, I suspect, play guitar and sing, it being such a powerfully efficient way of catharsising stress.  Mr Hands Sing had a name that could later be interpreted in one misdirectional way or another, during the period I refer to as the interrogation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I started taking a degree in psychology in 1998, at Plymouth.  Those first years were relatively uneventful.  I worked at a school in Jersey, teaching English as a foreign language during the summers.  In 2001, I found myself in relationship with a student, a woman the same age as myself, from Germany.  The afternoon that she left, she looked at me and stated that her father had friends in the Sicilian Mafia if it turned out that I was using her.  That night, despite me being, </span>heterosexual, I was drugged and seduced by a homosexual man, who was paid to do so, which was part of a greater strategy to induce fear in me.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal"><span style="font-size:18.666668px">Once he had seduced me, he ran a bath for me, beside which were left two glossy magazines, both with front cover articles on ‘how to blackmail your ‘straight’ boyfriend’.  The threat of blackmail forced me to speak out about the episode, and not knowing at the time that he had been paid to seduce me, I simply mentioned that I had had sex with a man.  This admission was induced on purpose, as it had just been rather forcefully requested of me that I be the godfather to the daughter of a work colleague, who was a rather threateningly large individual who had forced himself into my life, in a manner of speaking.  The father of the woman that I had been seeing was the regional manager for Europe of John Deere tractors.  Not until later did I realise the Dear John letter suggestion, but am certain that it was made.  The thieves misdirect attention away from themselves by appearing to be schadenfreude individuals.  The victim then finds themselves being encouraged by a deliberately created stereotype in the cultural media of wealthy ‘de sadean’ elitists.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">In late 2002, I was at University, having returned to complete my degree after taking a year out and working in the psychology department as a research assistant.  I had been asked out by a woman, who had three children, one of whom had been molested by a previous boyfriend.  I spent some time with her at the end of the summer holiday between my 2</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10.826668px;vertical-align:super">nd</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px"> and 3</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10.826668px;vertical-align:super">rd</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px"> year at university.  As I undertook the third year of my degree, I was attacked in a number of different ways.  There was an emphasis, on encouraging me to fail my degree and a smutty episode in my life, years before, was brought to bear upon me as the thieves set about de-libidinising me.  It was certainly the thieves who had instituted that smutty event, when I was a teenager, using hypnosis.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Just prior to the beginning of my final academic year at university, the woman and I were sitting down next to each other, when her daughter entered the room.  The daughter stated that she was bored.  The mother said ‘why don’t you take James into the garden and show him that thing’.  At her request, I followed the daughter into the garden and then walked around the garden following the daughter, a few feet behind. When we arrived back at the rear door to the house, which was one of a series of terraced houses, with similar gardens either side, the daughter started to shout ‘James, get off me, get off me’, which she repeated a number of different times.  I stayed silent for the duration, and then, when she had finished, keeping my cool, asked her to go back into the house.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I left that day, and didn’t return, but instead started experiencing a serious panic attack, that was augmented by an overdose of what I suspect to have been bismuth schellate, which damages the tone of the cardiovascular system.  The panic and resultant paranoia lead to me attempting to commit suicide, on Mount Edgecumbe, just over the Cornish border, when I returned to university.  The suicide attempt was preceded by several lecturers using that praxis based threat to further instil terror in me, and a period of silent treatment by people I had called friends.  They sent me to Coventry, the most difficult thing being that they would not tell me why.<br /><br />I was left thinking that these events were because I had committed some offence in some way against some individual or group, a garden path that I was led up, like every other victim.  After I tried committing suicide, I returned to Jersey, and spent the rest of the academic year confined to the family home.  I returned the following academic year and </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-size:18.666668px"> completed my degree in Psychology in 2003.  For a period of four weeks, three weeks before the beginning of my final term, for which 70% of the degree mark was awarded and during which I took my exams, I was sectioned into a mental hospital for the first time in my life.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-size:18.666668px">My doctor had seen fit to report my dishevelled state to a psychiatrist; when I visited the doctor I had discovered computer programming properly for the first time and had spent the previous four weeks teaching myself visual basic and direct x as I created a program to record reaction times to visual stimuli and had slept for about 4 hours a day.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-size:18.666668px">A doctor was not present when I was sectioned, and the South African psychiatrist, looked at me, and said, ‘we just want you to be happy’ in an ominous tone of voice.  It was a terrifying experience, as I was doing well in my degree, had an active and healthy social life, and did not display any symptoms of any issue with mental health, able to know that since I had just completed a module in clinical psychology.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">The psychiatric unit was typical of those places at the time.  It comprised of one large communal area, about forty feet by thirty, with a television behind a perspex screen that was barely visible for cigarette burns.  The floor was carpeted with carpet tiles, all of which were burnt with cigarette marks and some tiles were missing completely.  Around the edge of the room were a collection of plastic school chairs, again marked with the ubiquitous cigarette burns.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">An overhead extractor fan ran continuously, blocking out the sound of the television and in combination with the fierce fluorescent light led to a constant headache. There was a corridor outside leading to the dormitory beds in the ward.  Through the windows one could see a small area of garden, but in the four weeks that I was there, there were not enough staff to allow us out into the garden.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">It is the closest that I have witnessed to some form of hell and once in the psychiatric unit, I experienced institutionalisation for the first time.  After my 28 days of observation was finished, I was left on medication that prevented me from concentrating, and my dissertation, although relatively inspired, suffered as I was unable to write it up particularly well.  I was thoroughly traumatised by the incident, and the medication left me with nose bleeds every night whilst I slept and turned me from a normal, sociable individual with a healthy outlook on life to a drooling statue that couldn't sit down for more than five minutes without moving around.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L">Later on I passed my degree, largely because when I had received EMDR, the practitioner had performed his party trick and cured my exam stress.  For the first time in my life, I was able to write during my exams, without suffering a total mental block, and my exam results, coupled with the inspiration for my thesis, got me through and I was awarded a 2:1.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">However, the institutionalisation that I had received was entirely terrifying, and I was unable to piece together any reasoning for having been in that situation; there was no legitimate reason.  Over the next ten years I was hospitalised a further six or seven times, was unable to obtain employment and spent a fair amount of my time with people from the mental health community. This allowed me to get to know the individuals without being distanced by a professional label of some kind or other, the results of which you see presented in this book.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">The nose bleeds turned out to be due, in my opinion, to the severing of the veins that feed the olfactory bulb.  The consequence was a greatly reduced sensitivity to arousal, meaning I would never again experience a relationship.  As illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci, in his famous illustration the ‘Vitruvian Man’, or at least I suppose, the neural system is balanced at its extremes.  Thus the nerves of the left wrist impact on the nerves of the left ankle and right ankle and right wrist, and the nerves of the right wrist, on the right ankle and left ankle and left wrist.  In the case of the nose, the nerves of the olfactory bulb impact upon the genitalia, at the opposite end of a central pole.  These relationships are a matter of thermodynamic equilibrium in the total neural network that is the nervous system, I suspect.  When the nerves of the olfactory bulb are damaged, the affected individual becomes unable to gain sufficient arousal, as not enough cardiovascular resources are diverted to that area, the genitals.  Without the initial blood flow, stimulating the bodily (neural) memory of that aroused body state, which further encourages arousal and more cardiovascular resources, arousal does not happen.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">The thieves make certain that the victim stays alone; with no arousal, no relationships can occur.  At a later date, the victim can be interrogated for their academic insights.  In order to hide the consequences of the delibidinisation, and the reduced arousal, the thieves ran a stitch through my stomach and sewed a patch into my testicles.  The stitch diminishes the amount of colonic muscular contractions, and thus the amount of serotonin in the chyme that reaches the adrenal glands is reduced to the level experienced by an immature male.  The patch in my testicles, which was surgical gauze, was left inside the scrotum.  The stitching came undone, and exposed the patch.  It was a ruse to leave me with some ‘explanation’ as to why I should be experiencing the consequences that I did.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">They did this in a operating theatre in Plymouth.  I had been living alone, having returned to Plymouth to retake my third year, having attempted suicide after being pressured by the thieves when in Jersey, and having dropped out of my first attempt at the final year of my degree.  To try and maintain my sanity, since I was particularly lonely, unable to make friends on the degree that I was on, I would go out on my own to the pub, and one day, I was met by some distinctly unsavoury types, and watched whilst an observer tried to indicate to me that something had been put in my drink.  I drank anyway, and later on that week, my testicle swelled up to the size of tennis ball.  I went into Derriford Hospital and in great pain, was offered a pain killer that knocked me for six.  I was then asked to sign a release form, which I couldn’t possibly read.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I was then taken through for surgery under general anaesthetic, during which the surgeon sewed a patch into my scrotum, that I suspected to slow release what I thought to be a vasodilator of some kind.  This was also when they cut the veins to my nose, something I didn’t notice until being placed on medication later that year.  That they ran a stitch through my belly button to my colon, is supposition based upon the fact that I immediately after the operation began to develop a skin condition around my belly button, and much later, when I first started exercising, in 2016-ish, sit-ups caused me to experience a really bad pain in my gut, and after that my belly button didn’t experience that skin condition again, and there was certainly evidence of greater colonic motility.  Also, I am guessing this is why the English phrase exists for laughing so hard that your stomach hurts – ‘I laughed so hard I gave myself a stitch’.  During the interrogation, the victim laughs maniacally in a puerile manner not unlike Monty Python humour.  Perhaps a stitch has been observed in the past.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Because we gain our testosterone and oestrogen, as well as serotonin from the chyme in our stomach, by preventing the contractions of the full colon, the pressure with which that chyme is forced through into the adrenal glands, where it is filtered, is reduced.  This reduction prevents any secondary consequences of the delibidinisation occurring, so that no symptoms of delibidinisation will show.  This operation happened sometime around December of 2002, with the incarceration in the mental hospital happening in May of 2003.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">In 2004 I was able to demonstrate to my mother that my sleeplessness, that had started when I had obtained employment, was not due to stress, but due to a bronchodilator placed on my pillow.  This technique leaves the veins in the sinuses opening up as the victim lays their head on the pillow.  The greatly increased amount of oxygen suddenly reaching the brain, leaves the individual abruptly awakened, in to a state of mind that is as alert as one can be.  Sleep after that, becomes impossible.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">It is, I suspect, this technique that caused Michael Jackson to sleep in an oxygen tent, his seemingly bizarre choice being driven by not knowing what was causing his lack of sleep.  The bronchodilator has a half life of around 6 hours, at a guess, since the next morning, if one breathes in from the pillow, the effect is not noticeable.  This serves to prevent victims demonstrating the existence of the bronchodilator to any other individual.  Understanding this, as soon as I experienced the bronchodilator, I took it next door to my mother.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">I proved the existence of the bronchodilator to my mother by taking my pillow through to her.  I then asked her to place the pillow in front of her nose and breathe in.   She did so and suddenly looked utterly alarmed.   I am guessing that she told someone, and that the thieves, having discovered this, decided to remove me, as not long afterwards, I found myself encouraged to leave the island for some other place.  I left, and after a small tour of England, where I was herded down into Glastonbury village, and then found myself on some kind of psychedelic drug, writing essays about why I was there, what my political opinions were, what I thought about economics etc. <br /><br />All in all, I seem to recall that I wrote 5 essays, each taking a day, and each about 20 pages or more.  I wrote without stopping for hours, a consequence of the drug that I found myself on.  I did not take copies with me, leaving one copy with the manager of a homeless shelter, and another with a local lawyer firm that was named ‘Miller and Lyons’.  Since whilst writing, I had managed to lucidly assess that I was being scammed, I didn’t take any copies with me as a means of attempting to illustrate how worthless the content was to me.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">Before I left Glastonbury, I was exposed to a praxis based threat by some thugs, and some Indians.  Leaving Glastonbury, and via Bath and Wells, I found myself in Plymouth, where I eventually went to Derriford Hospital, in order to get some help for a blister I had developed on my heel.  Arriving there, I went into a cubicle where I was examined, eventually, by a doctor.  I was left in the cubicle for what seemed like an age, and peering through the curtains, I saw a clock outside.   When I arrived it stated 8.45pm, and later it said 8.30pm, before eventually reading 9 pm.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">It was here that I was tortured and conditioned, being placed into an ice-cube bath to make the conditioning powerful enough to raise a sotto voce narrative capable of getting me to harm my mother.  One of the technologies used by the thieves, is the use of targeted ECT, which I describe in better detail later, but which can be used to make a victim forget some experience or information.  At one point in this experience, where I was conditioned, I burnt a hole into my foot using a cigarette, and after I came out, when one of the doctors offered me my bag of harmonicas, I frenetically placed the bag in the bin, stating that I would never play again.  It was a test of the hypnotic condition, I suspect, which didn’t become obvious until much later.  In another test, the Indian surgeon, arrived at the cubicle, and with me lying on the observation platform, he looked me in the eyes and stated, ‘I could break your leg like this’ as he twisted my foot.  He showed no sign of any emotion other that focused aggression.  I was then placed into the same mental hospital, Glenbourne wing in Plymouth, that I had been in, in my final year at university.  I was taken out of the A&amp;E department to the secure mental health facility, down a corridor, where we passed the genito urinary department.  At the sight of this room, I started screaming and crying that I didn’t want to go back in there.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">In Plymouth, the day before I got to the A&amp;E department, I found myself in a predicament where I seemed to be lost, taking buses to try and get out of the city, but I then found myself almost herded towards a place near Plymouth, on the way to Exeter, a place called Plympton, where at the crest of a hill, a slip road departed the main motorway, and where the road was dangerously invisible and where cars departing the motorway would, unseen due to the crest, drive at breakneck speeds.  It was the type of place where fatal collisions were most likely to occur.  I walked towards Exeter, trying to thumb a lift.  I remember getting to some sort of factory, which I passed, as the sun started to descend towards the west of me, and then a sotto voce narrative started indicating some holy experience.  As I walked it rained.  When I turned around, the rain stopped.  When I turned back it started again.  I repeated the movement with consequent rain each time, several times.  I am relatively certain that it was a consequence of an advanced form of conditioning.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I got back to the slip road at Plympton, and eventually managed to cross the motorway, and started walking back to Plymouth, which meant walking up to the top of the hill that descended into Plymouth.  As I walked I got the most powerful sense of deja vu.  At one point, I suddenly found myself forty or fifty paces further towards Plymouth, in the blink of an eye.  I am now relatively certain that there are some fairly advanced forms of psychological manipulation available to the wrong people, members of the armed forces acting in a criminal manner.  The types of advanced conditioning techniques become more obvious, later, below in the text.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">After the A&amp;E department, in Glenbourne wing, I was exposed to some events to test that the hypnosis had been successful, including a fellow patient who believed she was the reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian princess, and I was then flown back to Jersey, with no choice.   She was black and wore blue eyeliner, and her presence, I suspect, was to make sure that none of the conditioning that was for later on, from around 2009 onwards, would show.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">A few weeks after I arrived, I found myself watching TV and a deliberate stimulus, the program ‘an island parish’, triggered the gated catharsis of the conditioned behaviour, and I found myself repeating, ‘follow the blue road, follow the red road’ in my sotto voce, after which I was freezing cold, for no reason, experiencing the painful freezing cold, despite standing next to a halogen heater.  The cold was the memory of an ice cube bath, which was used as a source of pain for the sake of conditioning me in a way so as to not leave any marks.  The pain was necessary because they were conditioning me to do some thing that I wouldn’t otherwise ever imagine, which was to get me to kill my mother.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">A conditioned internal dialogue began and continued in which I eventually left home and started driving around.  I argued with the conditioned set of statements, and defeated the ultimate end of the conditioning, which was to get me to kill my mother, an attempt, I would guess to tie up the loose ends with regards to the discovery of the use of the bronchodilator.  I was unaware of what caused the behaviour at the time, it is only in retrospect that I can make out what happened, since I have been put through many different examples of similar techniques more recently.  I was placed into a mental hospital, and my mother took out an injunction against me, leaving me moving away from home.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This episode, which is a consequence of me discovering the bronchodilator, is an illustration of the type of techniques used by the thieves.  The victim finds themselves in a situation where they ‘will never work again’.  Every time I tried to find work, I would find myself experiencing sleep deprivation.  The bronchodilator was only one technique used to incur that sleep deprivation.  Other techniques involved flashing ultra bright lights whilst I was asleep, induced tinnitus, using the mosquito effect (which affected me because I was de-libidinised), and deep, out of phase, bass sounds, that left the room feeling like it was vibrating.  Eventually, I developed strategies to deal with these experiences.  I used a towel over my pillow to defeat the bronchodilator, </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">and used a pillow speaker, playing ‘white noise’ in the form of rain fall, to defeat the induced tinnitus.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">So the thieves spot students, and then, where they can, they use a conjured up excuse to delibidinise the student.  This involves diminishing the levels of testosterone that the individual experiences.  Because that hormone is so important in arriving at memory, the delibidinisation acts in a traumatic manner, and the victim’s cognitive state continues to try and recreate the hormonal expression that it was used to for such a large part of the victim’s life.  This results in the victim happily living in surroundings that are effectively student digs, and studying for no particular reward. In effect the victim is continuously conjuring up the life he was leading before the delibidinisation, the body trying to recreate the greater testosterone levels.  It is my conjecture that there are ‘farms’ of former students around the country, all of those individuals effectively being intellectual slaves.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">In 2009, a period of what I call ‘the interrogation’ began.  Up until then, I had believed the attacks on me to be vigilantism, where I had been targeted deliberately because of some sexual indiscretion, such as the homosexual guy who seduced me or a much earlier experience with the dog.  It became clear across the course of 2010 and 2011 particularly, that the whole thing was designed as an act of theft.  What these thieves did was to put me into a mental hospital, from 2003 onwards, where the combination of medications was used to block my liver.  With the liver blocked, the speed of transport of blood was diminished greatly, and over that period my neural system became accustomed to the slower blood, as I continued to study as my bodies’ desire for testosterone continued to drive me towards recreating student life.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The slow release of the vasodilator into my blood stream around my genitals, from the patch in my scrotum, left me with erectile dysfunction, at least that is how I attributed it.  Currently, I think it far more likely that the veins in my nose being severed, which is the real reason for a lobotomy, left my neural system with no ability to put cardiovascular resources in the direction of my genitals.  I also experienced pain in my stomach, a form of irritation associated with ibuprofen like drugs, which again, I suspect was caused by a vasodilator implant.  The pain left me sleeping on my fist, pressing into my stomach, for almost two years.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Later on, as I </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">reasoned about</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal"> materialist psychology, I became aware of the relationship between the olfactory bulb and arousal, in the form of blood being biased into that area that creates the erection, and since I was experiencing nosebleeds when they put me onto the anti-psychotic medication, later on in the year, I suspect that the veins to my olfactory bulb were surgically severed.  The neural system is balanced, I suspect, with activity at one end being related to activity at the other, so as the olfactory bulb detects arousal, it dilates, and increased blood flow to the area stimulates increased blood flow to the genitalia.  It is a relatively obvious statement from the point of view of evolutionary psychology.  Anyway, for the first 4 or 5 years after experiencing these difficult issues, I could not get an erection at all, and for the first year I could hardly ejaculate, with ejaculation being greatly reduced for almost three years.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">In 2005 I demonstrated the existence of the bronchodilator to my mother.  In that intermediate period before the interrogation began in 2009, I worked a few times in temping positions, but always accompanied by difficulties sleeping.  You would have to know me to realise that I don’t suffer from issues with stress, which is generally the case, although I have been put through some seriously stressful issues.  But working, even temping in new environments, is something I had experience of when younger and so it shouldn’t have bothered me.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The sleeplessness was certainly caused by that same agency that delibidinised me but in each case, the psychiatric diagnosis could be brought to bear and the sleeplessness covered by a smokescreen of excuses suggesting that I am experiencing mental health issues due to stress and this is causing the sleeplessness.   This is what the thieves have done, they have designed, to some extent, the shape of psychiatric diagnosis, to the extent that they can hide their techniques using it as a smokescreen.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">So in December 2009, my liver was unblocked.  I had managed to get a job in May of 2009, and was working fine, when after I received my first pay check, within a day or two, a sleep disrupting noise began.  I put up with this, and continued to work obstinately.  After 6 months of 2 hours of poor sleep per night, I reached December, and then experienced a sharp pain in my stomach briefly.   In January I returned to work on the third, but the speed of my blood had increased back to normal levels, and my neural system wasn’t accustomed to it, and so I found myself unable to concentrate, at first.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I quit work on the third of January, unable to make a reasonable commitment to my employer.  As I quit, I noticed that it was peculiarly hot for the time of year.   It was thirty degrees, and cloudless blue skies.  This continued for three weeks, until late January.  It had been snowing before then, and was snowing afterwards as well.  I spent that three week period driving around the island, since driving forced me to concentrate, but arguing with a sotto voce dialogue, that I reasoned was my own subconscious unfolding.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The hot weather, I suspect, was an illusion created by the homeostasis mechanism being overloaded through lack of sleep, and then in combination with the suddenly unblocked liver, the warmed skin fed back in to my cognition and the resulting percept was one of hot weather.  I suspect that I join others who have perceived the experience as a ‘holy vision’ and probably am in the category of those people who are ‘half baked’, having slept in the large bottle shaped pottery kilns, for one reason or another.  The hypnosis, a conditioned sotto voce narrative, encouraged a pseudo-scientific ‘holy’ vision of what was happening.  An alternative that presents itself as an explanation for the perception of the hot weather, is that the warmth of the skin and neural system generally was the inverse of the extreme cold that I experienced when programmed to attempt to kill my mother.  In other words, it was the neural inverse of being immersed in a bath of ice cubes.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">What followed that hot period, in early 2010, was a year of shouting loudly, unable to cope with the sudden and violent reintroduction of my testosterone, whilst I was exposed to a hypnotic agency that made certain that I smashed and destroyed all things in my flat that were of sentimental value, cornerstones of my self being removed for the later attempts at hypnotic possession.  What followed was another four years of attempts at hypnosis (including an attempt to make me believe I was talking with an ancient Egyptian pharoah – if you recall the black woman in the mental hospital in Plymouth), whilst continuing to interrogate me for my intellectual insights.  If I stopped the hypnotic agency would hassle me painfully, until I continued to talk.   I would spend up to 16 hours a day, on my back in bed, talking continuously as I described my theoretical insights, and discussed the logical consequences, and I continued to shout, from time to time, and also laughed maniacally.  The laughter was always expressed in a form of rather puerile humour that could be best characterised as being similar to Monty Python, or, if you have seen the recent film of Batman’s nemesis, the Joker, then that type of laughter.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I am relatively certain that the fact that the neural system had accommodated to the slower speed of the blood with the liver blocked for that 8 year period prior to the ‘interrogation’ meant that the neural system was experiencing the now normal speed blood flow, as though that blood flow were much faster.  Because of this, my ability to logically segment the language I was using was far greater.  It was like practising the guitar a lot.  When one practises guitar regularly, eventually one reaches a point when the mind is able to move faster than the fingers and is able to control which direction the fingers will take.  The phenomenon of the ‘interrogation’ was like this with language, where I was able to logically segment sentential form to a point at which I was able to ‘trace out’ all the different combinations of logical consequences of the statements that I had made about the insights that I had already had.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This was due to the speed of the blood flow leaving the neural complexes in my CNS receiving blood faster than the CNS was used to.  Because of this greatly increased flow of blood, the CNS required oxygenated blood, and so the lungs adopted that puerile form of humour where they pumped oxygen into the blood.   I suspect that what is recorded by the appearance of Monty Python in the late 1960s, is that academics at red brick universities were under attack in the same way that I experienced.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Following the first four years of hypnosis were two years of continuous, computationally empowered hypnosis, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which I obstinately fought against, to prevent myself from becoming ‘owned’ hypnotically.  When this failed to defeat me, a further year of using information undoubtedly derived from the many studies of Fodorism, was employed to leave me for three months at a time with focused hypnosis to drive the blood in my brain to a particular location.   After three months of targeting one location in the CNS, the next three months was a different location.   The locations were targeted by designing the subject material of a panic laden episode so that that subject material was exclusively represented by the underlying neural complex of one particular part of the brain.  For the three months of that ‘episode’ the blood would flow to one position in the brain.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">This was used later on, to train my blood to two separate and incompatible parts of my brain, where it was held, using traumatic cycles to maintain its presence, until a stimulus would be introduced into my environment in order to trigger the sudden resolution of these unnaturally placed amounts of blood.  What followed was a sudden enormous drive to catharsise the sudden stress, which would occur according to a conditioned set of biases that would effectively gate the catharsis in a way that would leave me stating irascibly some conditioned statement or other.  The resulting look that I had during these conditioned episodes, was one of terrifying anger, which I countered by standing and explaining what was happening.  This was not so effective, since the experience was often met by people who were also conditioned.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Ultimately, the last few years have been about discrediting me, following my survival of the hypnotic elements of the interrogation.  I am currently being isolated from any contact with others, to a greater degree, having been forced away from the lunch time drop in centre, and also from open mics, my other social life opportunity.  In both cases hypnotic conditioning was triggered to force me into a situation where it was untenable to stay.  I also experienced the same frenetic nervous impulse to strongly stated catharsis whilst on holiday with my father and brother, leaving my brother not speaking to me, and my father not taking me on holiday to France again.  Those holidays, usually 5 days to a week, once a year, were all I had to get away from the island, so losing the opportunity, particularly to spend quality time with my brother and father, was a great loss to me. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">So, the thieves discredit and isolate the victim from the beginning, using the mental hospital as a smokescreen.  In many cases I suspect this works, but in mine, the EMDR had been so successful that I was able to maintain my composure for the majority of the time.  The fact that the EMDR had worked so well, is also one of the reasons why I was able to survive the ‘interrogation’.  The technologies that the thieves are using work around the principle of ‘whispering’.  It is this, I suspect, which has been discovered by the psycho-physiologists at the end of the 19</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> century as they were examining the just noticeable difference and the least noticeable difference.   What followed their discovery, was the abrupt end of psyche-physiology, and the creation of the psycho-analytic and behaviourist school, both polar opposites but neither relating with any certainty, the body to the mind, in the manner that this book, or as might be implied by the psyche-physiologists.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">During the hypnotic attack using ‘whispering’</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">, the body responds to stimuli that the person cannot consciously report hearing.  This is the basis of hypnosis, where something akin to the cocktail party effect allows the hypnotiser the opportunity to ‘capture’ the tongue of their victim and lead it towards some expression or other, by continuously repeating the expression, at a level of volume that is inaudible to the victim, consciously.  At least this is my guess, anyway.  The phenomenon is of a voice in one’s head, which is actually one’s own thoughts, although since you are not the instigator of the ‘drive’ for the thoughts, the phenomenon can suggest itself as the voice of some other, particularly if you are inclined to practise some mythological form of reasoning in which some other has control over you, such as a belief in God.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Across 2010, I spent much of my time shouting and lost in one belief or another as to who was attacking me. Many stereotypical beliefs informed mostly by Hollywood movies crossed my mind, where I blamed the Mafia, and others.  However, the interrogation began in earnest in 2011, when by that time I had stopped behaving with that initial ‘aggression’.  One of the things that occurred across 2010, was that the thieves talked me into smashing and destroying all objects that had any sentimental value for me, and made sure of this by talking me into selling my furniture before I left the island, in my car, for the UK, where I drove up to Scotland, and returned.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The loss of those sentimental items was to remove any support for my defence against the hypnosis, which worked for that first four years to try and ‘divorce’ my sotto voce self, into more than one character.  Aware that this was the case, I defended myself, and did so successfully.  The thieves seem to have been using computer aided hypnotic techniques, and I don’t think that anyone had defended themselves successfully from the hypnosis, for a number of years, possibly even a decade.  After four years, they seemed to resort to techniques that revolved around films from the 1980s, presumably having re-employed former agents, from before the computer techniques began.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The thieves employ a technique to hide their influence, where they use the heightened ego awareness of the victim, by designing films that have isomorphic content with the victim’s situation.  The use of films, along with other large expenditure techniques, is designed not only to intimidate the victim, but to also leave the victim discredited when they try and explain what they are experiencing.  The thieves, having been stealing intellectual patent for more than several hundred years are financially solvent to the point at which when they want to intimidate some individual, they can afford to fund the making of a film, and use their influence to influence the script writing to create this isomorphy.  The victim has generally not been exposed to the movement of such large amounts of capital, and is supposedly left in awe. Certainly, the victim is ‘negotiated’ further inside the semantic category of ‘madness’ when trying to describe the phenomenon. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Because my life when I was younger, through my dad, who owned and ran his own trust company, involved regular contact with extremely wealthy individuals, I know that to spend £10 on some event is the same as spending £1 million.  As long as one doesn’t lose money, then the two different values are effectively the same.  So, the vast amount of capital expenditure on some of the seemingly personalised forms of pragmatic threat is enough by itself to confront the victim with feelings of inferiority.  As it happens though, when one is spending large amounts of money, there is far less chance, generally, of not breaking even.  Because the films contain a structural isomorphy with the victim’s situation, where they work as films to induce fear or some other reaction in the victim then they can be used on other victims who are experiencing a similar ‘story’ (ie a similar set of techniques and circumstances).</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">Because this experience is so outside of the normal behavioural experience of others, it is all too easy to fall for the suggestion that it is just an episode of madness. However, I can demonstrate the existence of the thieves, with evidence, which I will leave for the statement that I am writing.  My point here, is to illustrate the techniques that they use, with reference to materialist psychology, a level of abstraction as a description that afforded me the opportunity to maintain ‘ownership’ of my self, despite the best attempts of the thieves to try and ‘possess’ me.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">So, the interrogation began proper, in 2011, and by this time, the neural systems experience of the flow of blood had begun to stabilise.  However, because logical introspection is an act of examining the potential branches of logic as one is thinking, when one can reflect on one’s thought as one is thinking it, one can trace out those different branches of thought.  This ability to reflect in real-time, was what the ‘tantra’ was all about.  The interrogation covered all the parts of the ‘research’(theorising about materialist psychology) that I had been engaging in for the previous ten years, surrounded my mental health patients as I reasoned.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I found myself not only describing my existing insights but also describing all of the logical consequences of those insights.  For the duration of this interrogation, I was ‘thinking out loud’, unable to think to myself, due to the neural systems inability to cope with the exposure to much faster than normal speed of blood.  Effectively I was catharcising the stress, by thinking out loud.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">For the period from 2011 until about 2013 or 14, I was interrogated almost continuously, allowed to leave to get my shopping, and occasionally other ‘outings’.  I refused to tell anyone what was going on, because I was terrified of being locked up in a mental hospital.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L"><span style="font-weight:normal">The years before the interrogation began in 2009, were characterised by the use of ‘anti-psychotics’ that caused continuous pain, albeit of a type that was more irritation than pain.  I spent at least four years on drugs that made me itch on the inside, unable to stop my foot from stamping ( a joke about dogs ), as these seemingly schadenfreude psychiatrists issued one prescription or another.  The more one questioned their actions the more painful the anti-psychotic that they would prescribe.  This behaviour, which was more or less the same across the members of that group of people who were long term mental health patients, was to encourage a form of ‘loyalty’ to the psychiatrist, but all it resulted in was a false impression that anti-psychotics ‘worked’, when actually, patients would toe the line or face increasing levels of pain.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Of interest to me, was whether the psychiatrists were actually aware of their behaviour or whether they were simply following training.  I am afraid I could not tell with any certainty, but they seemed to be drawn from a group of people who, as families, lean more towards that ‘Cain’ rather than that ‘Abel’ take on how society should exist.  I reason that they are drawn from a similar group, one that has enough money to fund their study as a family, since as psychiatrists they study for almost nine years, including becoming fully qualified general practitioners in the process, at least that is how I understand it.  I think this leaves them more likely to express and identify with a right wing political opinion, not necessarily a political situation that is entirely compatible with a good bedside manner, something that is reported by the majority of patients.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">What ultimately transpires is that a small section of unrepresentative society, a champagne set of individuals, become psychiatrists, and across their long training those that aren’t of that rigid mindset are evicted from the training process.  The result is that psychiatrists are from a group that is entirely unrepresentative of the social backgrounds that their stock and trade of patients is from, which tends to be the lower paid end of society, with some notable exceptions, in the form of middle class housewives reaching that point where their children leave home.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">So, I have regularly witnessed situations where psychiatrists listen to the story being recounted by some individual from a housing project, and judge it as evidence of insanity, despite the story being of a relatively normal occurrence in that person’s life.  Psychiatrists should be drawn from the communities that they look after, but the cost of becoming a psychiatrist is exclusive.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Also, the type of power that a psychiatrist wields, makes them a powerful target for corruption, since they can effectively sentence someone to torture, with no right to appeal or any fair ‘trial’, essentially suspending habeas corpus.  Social responses such as the patient advocacy group, do not go far enough to address this problem.  Meetings with psychiatrists need to be recorded on film or audio, for the sake of a second opinion, and for appeal.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The entire emphasis of the DSM as a diagnostic manual, was its introduction for the sake of providing accountability in diagnosis to prevent corruption by psychiatrists, which was demonstrated to be rife in the pre 2<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">nd</span> world war era.  During the interrogation period, I listened rather downheartedly to the news that the legislating body of Great Britain, had removed the requirement from psychiatrists to use the DSM.  The DSM 5 had become particularly unpopular, but when examined this seems most likely because homosexuality and transgendered issues had become accepted in the DSM 5 where the DSM 4 continued to define those behaviours as evidence of ‘illness’.  That right wing group that makes the psychiatrists, do not seem inclined towards acceptance of homosexuality, as a rule, although it is not made obvious.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The praxis based threats continue, from time to time, but as I knew when they first attacked me in late 2009, my neural system would recover from that trauma.  So, I bided my time, and eventually, a few years into the interrogation, started documenting the experience on Facebook.  I eventually recovered my normal demeanour, as I had predicted.  Across the course of the interrogation were attempts to drive me into one dialogue or another that would leave me perceived as ‘insane’ or other consequences.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">One of these was a relatively continuous attempt to force me into a dialogue about Christianity and religion in general.  I was supposed to be left with some apparent religious psychosis, as had most likely happened to the local well known individual, Mr Bisson (pronounced ‘bee song’ with a silent g), of Mont Cochon, but I fought back by turning those dialogues concerning religion to a rational analysis of religious experience and history.  The thieves techniques are characterised by a ‘damned if you do and damned if you don’t’ style of logical attack, and so my rational analysis was used to stimulate bad feeling to me from the religious community.  Or at least that is the impression that I and perhaps, others, were given, so that then any attack by the thieves on me, could be labelled as caused by riled Christians. </p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:14.0px"> <a id="Figure11MrBissonshouse"></a>Figure 11. The house of Mr Bisson of Mont Cochon.  Mr Bisson was known to have had a powerful intellect, having studied at several universities in Canada, I think, but by the time I was born he was busying himself with this linguistic house painting mission.   I presume that he was most likely attacked by the same thieves that attacked me.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The thieves also pursued an anti-monarchy strategy from the beginning, feigning the existence of the overt stimuli used in the hypnotic interrogation as being sourced in some manner from either the Queen or a representative.  The anti-monarchist stance that has grown across the course of the twentieth century and more so in the last 40 or 50 years, since the polytechnics began to open, is most likely traceable to the interrogations.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The victim becomes quite openly outspoken, with the rush of blood that the neural system is experiencing in the early part of the interrogation funding an adrenal power that sees the confidence of the victim potentially multiplied.  During these periods the victims most likely can perceive themselves as witty with a wry form of cynicism, expressed in a puerile manner that is recognisable as the humour of Monty Python, but is actually a consequence of the lungs needing to contract rapidly and repeatedly, in order to pump oxygen into the blood supply in order for the blood to be sufficiently oxygenated to allow for good neural metabolism to take place.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I would suggest that for people in my generation and below, who were not exposed to the Monty Python television series, were likely to find that part of the interrogation when their lungs were pumping blood in that way that left them with a bias towards puerile humour, emulating the humour of the film ‘The life of brian’, something that was encouraged as an act of discreditation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Across the beginning of the interrogation, for the first few years, the thieves attempted to make me leave my home, and move somewhere else.  I reasoned that this would leave me with diminished levels of social support, so I steadfastly refused to leave.  Amongst many different techniques that I employed to manage my situation during the period of the interrogation, I ‘self hypnotised’, employing repeated mantras and other techniques to stimulate myself in a direction that would empower me to survive the experience.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Before 2009, I had spent no time at all thinking about how hypnosis worked, but </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">from</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal"> 2009 onwards, I used the model of materialist psychology that I had been developing since before I was at University, to analyse the techniques used by the thieves.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">When, back in 2005, the torture with the ice cube bath had induced the conditioned behaviour to get me to attempt to kill my mother, the conditioning was triggered by the presentation of the program, ‘an island parish’, at which point I started repeating ‘follow the blue road, follow the red road’ over and over again, as the conditioned sotto voce narrative began, that ultimately lead to drive me to attempt to kill my mother (I had beaten the sotto voce before this occurred, discarding the knife that I had been expected to take, and replacing it with a pair of pliers, as well as fighting the sotto voce, when it was all triggered). </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">When the ‘interrogation’ began in 2009, I was presented with the one block of flats that constitutes that block in which I live, where all the flats have red doors, with the estate that is named separately, but is on the other side of the car park.  That estate is made of many blocks of flats, and they all have blue doors.  This stimulated a dialogue concerning empire vs republic, of Jersey, one island, vs Guernsey, which is many islands.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I am relatively certain that the interrogation was primed, at least in its early stages, by a leftover set of conditioned behaviours from that period in 2005 when I was conditioned using the ice cube bath.  However, as I resisted resiliently the influence of the interrogation, through a variety of techniques revolving around impression management, such as thought catching and reality testing, the interrogation changed to be more intense and more immediate, the result of the thieves hypnotising me in real time, present for lengthy periods of time as an influence over me.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The building in which I live, and have done since before the interrogation began, is rigged in a variety of ways to support the interrogation of a victim in the bedsits. The bedsit next to mine, on the other side of a thin wall, was empty for most of the time that I experienced the interrogation, the inhabitants apparently needing to spend time with their ailing parents.  I spent a lot of time shouting aggressively, a consequence of the speed of the blood, and the thieves recorded everything that I said, and, with contemporary technology, remembering that the thieves get knowledge first, through the interrogation of intelligent students post-university, potentially everything that I thought.  A brain implant is quite a likely technological development, supported by mobile phones, and connectionist networks.  I can detail the potential design of such a thing, so I assume that it has been thought of before.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The knowledge of neural activity in the brain has been present since the late 19<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span> century, certainly, with an ideal book to read being Ribot’s <span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn10" id="bodyftn10">10</a></span> theory of attention.  By the early 1920s there were most likely private dungeons containing victims with electrodes trailing from the back of their head, and by the 1940s the Nazis were discussing engrams, neural activity patterns.  From the late 1930s onwards there was little, if any, research into neural networks, despite the insight of the perceptron.  The sixties saw a reprise of interest, in connectionism, and the mobile phone network has most likely been sponsored rapidly into existence, in part, to support the use of the technology of implants.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Made from soluble suture material, with circuits made from microscopic balls of metal, small enough to pass the blood brain barrier, the chip injected in to the back of the head, simply needs enough pins to allow the neural activity that it records to be capable of representing a sufficiently discriminable amount of neural patterns to be joined to a corpus of recorded speech of the individual, using a connectionist network.  If this doesn’t exist, then I’d like to see it implemented, in order to use it for disabilities and post laryngectomy patients, for the creation of speech.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I hypothesise that the cerebellum has developed for the fining out of the motor behaviour of the tongue, and if this is the case, then a chip inserted into that general area may be able to discriminate tongue movements, a sufficient basis for discriminable speech.  In the case of the discovery of the nefarious use of such a device, should it be required, the suture material is dissolved, and the metal balls pass through the blood brain barrier and are excreted in the urine.  It was reported in the news about 8 years ago, that Japanese scientists had developed a new manner of brain imaging, where they used small metal balls that were small enough to pass through the blood brain barrier.  Perhaps the suggestion that that technique has been used could be used to cover any evidence of a brain implant.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This suggestion, that there is a brain implant, stems, in part, from an experience that is undoubtedly common to all who experience the ‘interrogation’.  That is that as it starts and continues, the victim is asked to state what he/she thinks is causing the sotto voce narrative that one is experiencing.  The thieves listen to the response, and then, using suggestion, shore up the victim’s reality in a way that conforms to that explanation that the victim has provided.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">In this way, the thieves are able to extract a useful definition, according to current technological limits on the imagination, that they can then develop as an ideal, encouraging young disenfranchised individuals to embrace it and consider the consequences, for them to develop the ‘myth’.  In the case of a brain implant, it is the holy grail of spies, and so any chance of developing it would be taken, in secret, by our own spies, let alone others, and they and the technology is then used by the thieves.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">One of the techniques that they can use, I suspect, as ‘evidence’ to support their suggestion that there exists some external awareness of the individual victim’s thoughts, is by interrogating the victim whilst they are asleep.  In order to do this, they need to be able to get the victim to think out loud, and then get the victim to be focus on some event from during the day.  I would suspect, if I were to try and model the experience, to provide empirical support to study how to be safe from the effect, that when typing in passwords or engaging in some other behaviour, the thieves can place into sotto voce, subconscious experience, some statement that the victim has stated whilst under duress at some point.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Then, whilst the victim is asleep, a repeated mantra is played back that incorporates that same statement, as well as some statement that asks for the victim’s password.  Later they then provide evidence that they have been able to ‘hear’ the victim’s ‘thought’.  There are other tricks to achieving the same end, that rely on the automaticity with which we complete sentences when reading, and other spoofs of the predictive mechanism of cognition.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">In any case, it is my experience that much of the things that I have said are recorded for later use against me.  There are definite techniques that surround this. The first is that the thieves must use an indexable database of thematic content tags of my corpus of speech.  Armed with this, later frauds and ‘blags’ can be tried, in particular the attempt at the creation of some ‘spiritual’ ‘evidence’ of some external force or agency.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Also, the extremely high adrenal states encountered during the early stages of the interrogation, are re-creatable as an influence on the body, and thus the mind, by replaying my speech from that time below my conscious awareness.  As long as the speech is discriminably related only to that time, then the re-experiencing of that bodily state will re-occur, particularly, in fact perhaps only, when that language is part of a neural complex that has occurred during that day, as a potentiated but unfulfilled action, to be sublimated neurally during sleep.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I mentioned that the building that I live in was designed as rigged.   I suspect that buildings like this exist in every university town, at least, and also in major cities, etc. The corridors have wooden ceilings, which I suspect leaves those unaware of the design of a building (I studied civil and structural engineering when I left school), imagining that the influences that they are experiencing as ‘voices’ or thoughts, as coming from upstairs.  A lot of empty blocks of flats existed in the 1980s, with boarded over windows, and at least some of them most likely were of this design, with the interrogation causing violence between residents.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The technique of ‘whispering’ became, I suspect, a consequence of triangulated and crossing radio telescopy, that causes vibration in the building, that has sufficient resolution as a technique to impart a whispering consequence into individual rooms, their elevation and orientation known.  I think that this technique was most likely discovered after the building of Chandrigarh, and New Brasilia, by Corbusier, as the thieves at the time were searching for a replacement for whispering down chimneys, for which they had invented the story of Santa Claus, in case the children, who are more sensitive to the high frequency whisper (hoarse whispering?), had heard them. With modern flats increasingly not having chimneys, the thieves established this radio telescopy artefact, and then contracted Corbusier to build buildings to study the psycho acoustic properties of the buildings.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:14.0px"><a id="Figure12DampCircles"></a>Figure 12. Damp circles in a pattern that may be an artefact of the use of radio telescopy or some other distance form of manipulation, but which may be due to structural issues, although, having had a brief training in Civil Engineering, I cannot think of any example of a structural issue that would lead to this.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I have mentioned that films are made to attack victims, but they are also used in pursuit of ‘information management’, where films are created to mimic some scientific eureka insight that has been discovered. The resulting gossip, of isomorphic phenomena to the described scientific insight, prevents the spread of that information, the aggregative effect of the human brain’s cognitive mechanisms, aggregated across the many millions of people in a society.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">An example might be Mr Spok, in the latter half of the twentieth century, with his catchphrase ‘from my mind to your mind’, blocking out the spread of information relating to the emerging scientific field concerned with ‘memetics’, perhaps one of the most important fields of inquiry in understanding human behaviour, especially in opposition to genetics as a scientific explanation for behavioural cause.  Also in  learning, and communication generally.  Later on, as just another example from many, is GhostBusters, where the ‘crossing of the streams’ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyKQe_i9yyo) that leads to nuclear explosion or similar, is a reference to the use of radio telescopy to create the modern technological equivalent of the high frequency sub conscious auditory influence of ‘hoarse whispering’.  The film blocks out the gossip, preventing it from spreading, and is released to cover some leak of the technique.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">To return to this building, it has a line of flats with blue doors on the other side of the car park, and behind that was a quarry.  It had laid empty and unworked for at least twenty years, I think, but because I survived the interrogation without losing my sanity, (unlike previous residents, I suggest) the thieves inaugurated the selling of the quarry for development.  As the pile drivers worked to create the foundations, they cracked a pipe, sealed and filled with water, that had its end underneath this building.  The consequence of this deliberate undermining saw this building collapse, leaving the gutters in the corridors outside the flats unable to drain.  The water soaked through the old and exposed grout and the tile adhesive seems to have been deliberately scabbled in the direction of this flat, reaching it from a low area.  The pressure of water at that low area was enough to create osmosis and my bedsit became unbearably damp, with terrible rheumatic pain occurring across the first winter after the quarry began its development.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The tiles on the floor of the corridor outside, which extend down the narrow and steep staircase, are so slippery when wet as to be highly dangerous, and the consequence of the interrogation had been that my cardiovascular situation has been one of permanent stress, therefore inflating it slightly, leaving my adrenals less able to steer blood to the correct place, and leaving me with rheumatism developing.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The stiffness of my painful limbs would have been enough to see me collapse on the slippery tiles outside and experience harm, something that may have been entirely likely given the cardiovascular damage that I was supposed to have experienced.  I mitagated against cardiovascular damage leading to the type of arthritic condition that would have seen me likely to slip and fall on the wet tiles outside, by continuing to go to the gym three times a week.  Experiencing some form of harm has been something that the thieves have concentrated on over the course of the last 4 or 5 years, as they are keen to try and pursue a suggestion to witnesses that I am experiencing terribly consequences of having questioned religion.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">At one point, early into the interrogation, perhaps 2011 or 2012, I could not stop myself from being triggered into a cathartic state where I was shouting (I had also spent most of 2010 shouting).  I was desperate for some help, so I thought, since the thieves had been attempting to turn me against Catholicism, that I could at least engender observation by Catholics by gaining their attention.  The Catholics that I have known have all been extremely good people, pursuant of high ethical standards, and they think about </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">their practice of ethics carefully</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">, so I decided upon a ruse, and shouted out of the window a couple of things that could be interpreted in two ways.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The first thing I shouted was that the Pope is a paedophile, and that Jesus was a paedophile also.  The word paedophile in Greek means lover of children, but not in the carnal sense, and I wanted to remind myself of my theorising at the time of the consequences in contemporary language (as thought), of changing meanings of words.  In essence, if your grandparents generation practised one meaning of a some idiomatic phrase, and the meaning of that phrase is changed, then it can have unintended consequences of interpretation etc in the later generation.  To take the opportunity to mention it, think of ‘for king and country’, and ‘for crying out loud’, and hear phrases, popular in the 1920s, that combined with the consequences of 2</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">nd</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal"> world war trauma are what resulted in post war Britain adopting the use of the word ‘fuck’ and ‘fucking’ (from ‘for king’).  Britain’s fall, managed.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Within several hours of me shouting that the pope is a paedophile, seven policemen had arrived, one with a police dog.  I have no record of having committed any violence, nor of aggression particularly, although there has recently been some attempt to frame me as such.  At the time they arrived, the use of taser guns was illegal.  They pinned me to the floor and placed my hands in a metal retaining handcuff that was joined solidly in the middle, the type that was banned in the late 19<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span> century as part of the reforms.  As six of the policemen all started talking to one another, in pairs (something I think to be a triggered hypnotic technique of distraction), the seventh knelt on my back and tasered my left wrist.  This left me with potential nerve damage, that left me increasingly experiencing arthritis, and increasingly unable to play bar chords on my guitar.  Three weeks afterwards, most likely because I didn’t run away, as I was being pressured to at the time, taser guns were legalised.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">So, challenging Christianity, and gaining Arthur-itis (like the pagan Englishman that apparently I am), to add to the Room-atism.  The cynical, schadenfreude humour of the thieves, which is yet another subterfuge, can be heard.  They make entire sections of generations into cynical, sadistic individuals, breaking their childhood enthusiasm in some way, as a smokescreen that the victims will then point at, misidentifying the sadistic individuals as the cause, presuming some schadenfreude elitist to be the cause, rather than the thieves.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">There are many other events that occurred, but hopefully this has given you a flavour of what victims have been experiencing.  With regards to the water ingress into my room, I bought and used some waterseal, something the building’s landlord should have done, and I also mop the gutters of the corridor every day, pushing the stagnant water into the drain, sometimes more than once, if it is raining.  If I didn’t do this, then I would certainly experience lasting pain from autumn to spring, inclusive.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The technologies that have been being used by the thieves have exponentially multiplied across the course of the twentieth century.  Apart from radio telescopy, and brain implants, both of </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">which are</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal"> conjecture but are also most likely, given the ease with which they can be realised, and the use of films like ghostbusters to block out knowledge of the crossing of the ‘streams’ of radio telescopes, there are many other techniques.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The film ‘The clockwork orange’ for instance, is to block out discussions of the use of a particular technique, which is the use of targeted ECT, where the power and frequency of the ECT, delivered in small amounts to the temples, rises and falls, in conjunction with an audio message that is presented in headphones.  This is done, generally, whilst the victim is asleep, encouraged by some ether or similar.  Using this technique the thieves can induce in their victims many different consequential effects.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">When in the mental hospital in the years before 2009, when the interrogation began, and I resisted, if I confronted my parents regarding my treatment, then they would automatically respond due to this conditioning technique.  They would both accuse me of raising my voice, and this would trigger in me the catharsis of a similar behavioural training, and I would raise my voice.  It was only when I noticed that both of them were responding in the same way (they lived separately by then), that I realised it was conditioned behaviour.  Effectively what the technique does, is present a pain that is experienced by the neural system of the brain as greatly increased work. The brain then avoids stimuli that are associated with this work, i.e. the audiologically presented stimuli.  Using this technique, behavioural exchanges can be programmed into a couple, or entire beliefs.  The brain has no neurons for reporting pain, and effectively all that is happening is that the brains cognitive economy routines are kicking in leaving the individual steering away from the stimulus that is presented.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Whenever I try and explain what’s been happening to me to my parents, their brains start working harder, a consequence of the use of targeted ECT pain avoidance behaviour, and they almost immediately sneer and almost with aggression, negotiate themselves away from my explanation in one way or another.  These theives have been using targeted ECT on my parents, for many years, even now when they are both over the age of 70.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">My GP in the early days of my incarceration, was treated quite obviously to this technique.  Eventually, a few years later, his vision was greatly effected (most likely due to venous damage to the extra-occular muscles behind the temples) and the continuous adrenal treatment that he had been exposed to at the time, was enough to drive him into a lasting fit of depression.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">My father sometimes goes to his house in France, alone, simply so that these thieves can target him there, since when at home in Jersey, he sleeps in the same bed as his wife, which stops them from attacking him.  My mother, on the other hand, sleeps alone, with the exception of a cat, which might perhaps prevent the theives from attempting to penetrate her room whilst she sleeps.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This technique of targeted ECT, is something that has been developed using homosexuals across the course of their incarceration in mental hospitals across Europe, Britain and America, as well as other countries most likely, across the course of the mid to late twentieth century.  It was in full use by the late 1960s, when the film Clockwork Orange was made.  I greatly suspect that the British establishment fell to the thieves at around this time.  The thieves use the targeted ECT to condition opinions, entire dialogues, sotto voce narratives, conversations, political exchanges.  They specialise in turning people against each other.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">For the last twenty years, the thieves have endlessly pursued any form of dialogue that will turn me against my father for instance, attempting to imply him as the cause of many varieties of woe that befell me from university onwards.  They try still, but fail.  They are most likely exploiting some observed regularity of human nature that, like I previously mentioned, is a consequence of some underlying process of identity separation, between father and son.  A similar phenomenon, I guess, may exist between mother and daughter. Ultimately, they are after funneling the inheritance into only one sibling, so that they can attack that one person, as a child, leaving them unlikely to be anything other than single, so that they will receive the inheritance, in full, as the other sibling is either dead, through suicide, or disinherited.  They then marry the lonely sibling, after or before they have inherited, as an act of theft.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The use of computational power to aid this process, has resulted, in my opinion, in the development </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">of the ability to engage in a</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal"> complete ‘possession’ of an individual by encouraging the development of an entirely seperate alter-ego.  When the thieves first started on me in late 2009 and early 2010, they began by courting some holy messianic story, to explain the perception that I had of hot weather in January.  Effectively they simply asked how I interpreted it and then developed that.  If an explanation works on me then it might work on others, so the interrogating thieves are always keen to find out what your explanation of witnessed events is.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">They then started trying to divide my sotto voce self into more than one person, starting by using some technique, most likely delibidinisation in conjunction with hypnosis, to rob me of my normal sotto voce personal pronoun self referent, and to replace it with a third person personal pronoun, so that I was commenting about myself when thinking, as though I was in conversation continuously with an other. They spent several years trying to divide me, in fact longer than that.  Recall that my flat had been entirely emptied of objects with any sentimental appeal, easing their capacity to try and ‘possess’ me.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">At one point they used a hypnotic algorithm, which was like being exposed to a chant that would swing one way and then another, as if conversation were occurring between two individuals in my head.  This was followed by an attempt to talk me into a trance, and then enclose my ‘self’ with these two ‘others’ that had been coerced into existence in my sotto voce.  The phenomenon of this pincer movement, was one of slowly disappearing into ones self away from ones eyes to the extent that one could see one’s eyes from the inside as disks, surrounded by blackness.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The film ‘Get out’ (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/) played a similar sequence, and I wonder if it is not being reported elsewhere or, perhaps, reports of its occurrence are blocked by the film.  Getting out though is the wrong thing to do.  Recall that they tried to make me leave for a few years?  Well, that is the individual on pilgrimage, or any other reason for leaving home suddenly.  Once away from those who care for the victim, it is unlikely that the thieves won’t take the victim and are able to harm the victim further, more easily.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The film ‘Being John Malkovich’ occurred at a time when technology had certainly matured enough to allow the thieves to possess someone utterly.  I am almost certain that films are used to document the progress of the thieves so that they can read how they succeeded, at a later date, perhaps when they are next attacking a society.  There is another technique, in which they, the thieves, attack many different groups of people using similar sets of techniques (similar ‘stories’) for each group, and then put a </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">superordinate</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal"> isomorph into the film that relates to all the different techniques that they have used.  The victims watch these American blockbusters, and are encouraged into the ‘hearing of secret messages’, as a technique to render their victims into the mental hospital, where they can exert more control over them.  The 2019 film ‘Joker’ offers the individual attacked American student, an isomorph for their inability to stop bursting into laughter during their ‘interrogation’, that steers them to violence or other consequences, such as leaving them biased to perceive an elite as dangerously against them.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The films ‘the Twilight saga’ leave the victim potentially biased into believing that they are immortal, as well as drifting about from town to town.  By that time, though, they will have been delibidinised some years before, and as their friends hair turns grey through age, theirs remains coloured, and their armpit hair disappears, only a few whispy strands remaining (my experience).  It is not the directors, or the actors, not the scriptwriters or producers who are responsible for the design of the films in this manner.  The scriptwriters, and directors and producers, to some extent, are hypnotised into producing the copy that the thieves want to see produced.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Not only films, but scripted talk radio, as well other mediums of cultural media, are used.  They all rely on the fact that the ego relates information to itself when under pressure.  The individual in that situation is experiencing the artefactual consequences of an evolutionary prerogative, where they pay more attention to themselves, sub consciously, when they are being chased.  This allows them to look forward and concentrate behind them with special reference to their own situation, in order to evade capture by a predator.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">In talk radio, for instance, the radio presenters conversation can be made staccato, pausing in unexpected places, in a way that then leads the stressed victim to perceive the conversation in a way that relates to themselves.  The technique is carefully orchestrated, and designed to elicit ‘hearing messages from the radio’ in the victims, whose fight/flight complex leads them into a sub-conscious overextension of the sub clauses of each spoken sentence.  The narrator pauses in an unpredictable place, the victim then automatically completes the sentence, leading them to interpret the sentence in a way that is narrated by their ego complex. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">  The thieves didn’t expect me to live or survive with my freedom intact.  They thought that I would either attempt suicide or run from the island, and no longer represent a problem to them.  So I narrated, out loud, how they were engaging in their acts of hypnosis, for the entire duration of the attempt to steal from me, explaining their techniques by reference to my psychophysiological model.  This model was sufficiently complete, and sufficiently valid to make accurate predictions, allowing me to defeat most of their attacks.  I shocked them, I think, since they hadn’t been defeated by a target since computers were introduced into the hypnotic act, sometime in the early 1990s, I would estimate.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">There are ‘markers’ left lying around in my environment, locally, to suggest to some later investigating agency that I am being communicated with by some local network, in order to ‘prove’ that I am an artificial construct, a ‘prop’ created by some nefarious agency or other.   I think that there is an ongoing attempt to try and misdirect any investigating agency into thinking that I am not independent of some other influence, perhaps a left wing extremist group of some kind.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Ascertaining that these are props to misdirect some future investigation, and not simply a consequence of my ego, that is relating events to myself unnecessarily, is not possible directly.  Instead, statistical likelihood suffices to indicate whether or not the event is likely to be an external agency, at least where one has not the ability to decide in any other way.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">There are other ‘markers’, that have been left in the local environment to the island where I live, that are related to attempts by the thieves to hypnotise the local population to encourage them to distance themselves from me and from this book. As I entered the library today, there is a large, LED tv sign on which notices are announced.  One of these advertises a social group for local writers, the name to contact is James Sillwood @ ….com.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Signage like this can be presented in the peripheral field of people who are passing it, and later, mass hypnosis techniques can be used to work that label into some greater context.  James Ill would (in the context of writing).  It is a ‘prop’ capturing the implicit memory of peripheral vision, just as I was threatening to publish my book.  Most likely it would prime some potentiated response that, each night as the public slept, would be present in the high frequency ‘hoarse whispering’ subliminal auditory sub-conscious environment to support some suggestion that this book will encourage illness.   Not long after I spotted this and mentioned it on Facebook, and wrote this paragraph, the email contact details were changed. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">However, I hope you realise that this book is both theoretical in nature, and that one of the things that it highlights is that modern medicinal theory is largely a construct by some thieves who are making money both from the pharmaceutical industry and from their continued ability to poison people, and who are also funding the lack of understanding into subjects like ‘pain’ since they use threats of pain as well as delibidinisation to encourage hypnotic responses to their conditioning techniques.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">They have certainly controlled the development of psychiatric diagnosis, disguising any attempt by some uninformed member of the general public to describe hypnosis, by arriving at the diagnostic description of ‘thought implantation’ or ‘thought broadcasting’. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Whilst it can be observed that these conditions are often percieved in the verbal reports of people experiencing schizophrenia, I would suggest that the cause of the mention by people with schizophrenia is that the concept of thought implantation and broadcasting has been entered, deliberately, into public cultural impressions of madness, then taken up by the individuals with schizophrenia as culturally validated examples of their own experience useful for describing their own experiences.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">When trying to understand how to deal with the thieves I arrived at a rather counter intuitive solution.  Their incursion into my living space, which they would engage in to ensure that my personal space would feel smaller, in order to encourage a cathartic response, was something I responded to briefly at first, by fitting an alarm, of the type with a reed-switch on the front door, and double locking my door.  I decided relatively quickly that locking my front door and using an alarm was going to psychologically project my living space upon my mind as though it were a compound, in which I was trapped.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">One thing I know about the thieves with absolute certainty, is that they never leave evidence of their existence.  The little evidence I do have I include in a separate document, which I have called ‘a statement’.  With regards to their incursion into my room however, at night, particularly, I eventually decided to leave a heavy object in front of the door, one that could not be replaced from the outside when the door was closed.  This meant that they could not enter without leaving evidence of their having been in.  The consequence was that they didn’t come in at night again.  During the day, they occasionally come in, but less so than they used to. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Before I used the heavy weight though, and I eventually bought and fitted a chain to the door, which has less psychological ‘weight’ than locking it at night, the bastards came in whilst I was asleep one night, and I woke up groggy and with a three inch red circle on my chest, directly above where my heart is.  I surmised that the red circle was the consequence of a handheld ultrasound device that had been used to attack my heart.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">My physiology slowed down with in a week, and I was left realising that I would need to exercise in order to try and regain my health.  I also used garlic laden hummus, in quantity, to support my exercise regime, hummus being protein and garlic being known to be good for the cardiovascular system.  I hadn’t exercised since school before that, and not much even then, but I started going to the gym regularly.  This was in order to try and heal the damage to my heart and deal with the consequences which presented themselves, at first, in the form of neuropathy.  This neuropathy had diminished the strength of my already damaged left hand, which was causing neural inactivity in the left ankle through neural sympathy.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I exercised, eventually settling on the treadmill, which I set at the highest walking speed and the highest elevation, for a time which I built up to an hour.  I sweated like I was in a shower, but continued.  I survived, and now exercise three times a week and have a sauna, to try and encourage good cardiovascular tone to recover after the prolonged episodes of the high tension during the interrogation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I also decided to come off the quetiapine, since I knew that it was responsible for lowering my blood pressure.  So, I obtained a pill cutter and came off the drug in a really slow regime, taking almost 6 months to full come off, knowing from past experience that it sometimes takes 18 months before the consequences of the ‘medication’ are gone.  Quetiapine, like all other ‘anti-psychotics’ is a metaphorical prison.  The drug, should one come off it immediately, or even if one came off it over a few months, would ultimately leave the individual experiencing psychotic symptoms purely as withdrawal effects from the drug.  The drug is then given out in three month sets, of one month each, limiting your ability to leave.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I eventually spoke to my psychiatrist, about two years after I had finished taking the quetiapine, and asked to come off the quetiapine formally.  We arrived at a withdrawal schedule that slowly took me off.  When that had finished, attacks on me started as I will describe later.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The anti-psychotics are torture chambers.  They induce miserable levels of pain in their victims.  In me it was so painful, in those years preceding the interrogation, and just before the interrogation began, I was switched to the relatively benign quetiapine.  Throughout the interrogation, I dared not say what was happening, as I was terrified of being taken back and put onto the revoltingly painful medication. Medications like clozaril, depixol, chlorpromazine, amongst others, left me unable to think straight or to engage in any practical activity, or any sedentary one, and with drooling and stamping of my foot as extra-pyramidal side effects, it felt like a permanent insult about the dog experience, which I had been hypnotised into when younger.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This was added to by my inability to do anything, or even sit down for five minutes due to restlessness, by day time television showing endless repeats of Friends, of which you have none once you reach that state, and Frasier, the comedy psychiatrist.  Revolting Americana designed for purpose.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I mentioned earlier that students are spotted at university and others are attacked from an earlier age.  I am one of those that was attacked from an earlier age.  The thieves left an impression in my life made up of hypnotised experiences, in which I was framed in a particular light.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The bastards continuously tried to turn me against my family, and most likely vice versa.  At one point, my mother went to India on holiday, and whilst she was away she asked me to water the tomatoes in her greenhouse.  I turned on the music on the stereo up high, so that I could hear it whilst watering.  My brother came down stairs angrily and turned it off, remonstrating with me for having it loud.  I went back up and turned the hi-fi on at the plug, only for the music to immediately come back on at full volume.  My brother entered the room and an altercation broke out which saw him break a chair over my back.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">It was undoubtedly programmed, and as I left and waited for my friend to take me to hospital, just as I was supposed to be playing harmonica in a radio broadcast gig, I stood at the top of the steps by the gate to the house, and tried to tell him about the fact that the right wing were trying to set me up as a peado, and the language came out like ‘I could tell others about you living alone with mum and suggest you were a peado’.  It was language that had been deliberately conditioned over the top of the sotto voce set of words that I was planning to use to tell him about my difficulties.  Deliberately, hypnotically gated catharsis.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I have seen other examples of this relabelling of semantic content of a person’s speech.  The most prominent example belonged to a friend of mine from school who had ended up in the mental hospital.  He went to University when he was 18, where as I left it until I was 27.  He experienced the ‘clockwork orange’ machine in an earlier guise before it became completely function with computational aid.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The consequence was that he would initiate a spoken sentence, and when reaching the first potential conjunction, he would erupt in what looked and sounded like a massive state of utterly confused aggression.  His sentences didn’t have any meaning at all, and were just bizarre.  However, I eventually listened to the content of his frustrated attempts to communicate, and it turned out that he was trying to say something that his brain had been steered away from stating, and this left him experiencing utter frustration as he struggled to use semantically close in meaning, semiotic prototypes of related concepts which would be issued by him.  His resulting frustration presented itself as aggression.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">He had been like that, on and off, for many years, most of his adult life, and it was utterly horrible for him, not knowing what was happening or what was causing it, and he must have experienced the greatest loneliness.   I realised that I could prove the existence of the clockwork orange machine by demonstrating the regularity with which he adhered to these second order descriptive terms, and mentioned confidently in my room, thinking out loud, on my own, that I could do this.  My friend committed suicide only a few weeks later.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Another friend of mine was also beset with the consequences of a similar intervention, in the form of conditioning, that left him in a similar state, although not to the same extent.  The technology has obviously been maturing.  He died in the same week, a car accident, apparently.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">  Throughout the ‘interrogation’, there were endless attempts to convince me that I was some weird individual, in a way that would leave me believing something that would distance me from any concept of sanity.  I got to be the grandson of Edward the 8</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">, the illegitimate child of Charles Windsor, the prince of Wales, I got to be Jesus, the returned, and God.  Often I got to be God.  The thieves exploited the fact that my adrenals were rising to extremes during the interrogation and did their best to overlay, across this extreme rise, an ego complex led personality of one kind or another.  They failed, because I continued my narrative of what was occurring from a psychological point of view, basing it in my theory as presented in this book.  It had occurred to me that if one is left in a situation where one has to keep information to oneself in order to survive, or have advantage over thieves, then one has not truly one any life worth living.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">To have to hide information, deliberately, is not a place that I would prefer to live, so, I thought out loud, describing the things that were being done to me, as I perceived them, and described the underlying theoretical description, as well as openly stated all of the possible counters that I might engage in.  I would then openly select a course of action and take it, arriving at a place where the thieves could not successfully attack me in that manner, even when they knew what I was doing. Occasionally, I did deliberately keep information to myself, for advantage, I suppose, but quite rarely, as there is no real advantage in doing so.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This former paragraph, for instance, could be used by some information management executive to suggest that I have done a wrong thing, in giving away information about how I was arriving at a solution to the problems that were presented to me.  It could be argued that in doing so, I empowered the thieves.  It could further be argued that I am, in writing this book, and this description of the thieves and their techniques, empowering others to engage in the crimes that I describe.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">That argument is actually the status quo, and has been for a long time.  It leaves us with some section of our defences, as secretive, secreting the information about the crimes around us.  This leaves us in a state of blindness, as the public, unable to see the crimes around us, as we are not able to access information about how they operate.  Had that information been made available earlier, I might not have found myself going through this crime as the victim, to the extent that I have done.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Furthermore, had society practised openness, then the thieves would have been spotted long ago, and would not have been able to entrench themselves as deeply as they have done.  Worst of all though, is that once we have some body of secret agents, the thieves can use them with ease, in the same way that they employ any group that exists or that they can raise into secrecy.   Once each group practises secrecy, they are ripe to be controlled hypnotically.  Now that we have this edifice of the internet, we should use it for the sake of sharing our knowledge of how criminals work, so that we can spot them.  We can even go further, and as concerned citizens across the planet, we can join up our attempts to defend ourselves.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">	If we know about the techniques, then we can see them when they are practised.  Across the course of my life as a victim of these thieves, each time that I spoke out about some issue, another would be forced into my life, so when I spoke out about the sexual abuse at around the age of 16, I found myself hypnotised into having sex with a dog.  The event was preceded for the day or two before by my sitting around saying what seemed like profound observations.  I had been drugged, in retrospect, most likely delibidinised in order to make me more susceptible to the hypnosis.  I recall sitting at the bottom of my Brother’s stairs to his bedroom, and staring at the rag rolled varnish of the faux grain of the door in front of me, and seeing faces looming out of the grain.  The first thing that </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">they tried,</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal"> was that, wanting to experience some homosexual act, I went up to my brother’s room whilst he was asleep, and thought about touching him.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">	It was something that I couldn’t possibly do.  I hadn’t given the abuse much thought at the time, a state of denial, effectively, but when confronted with the option it was inalienably unavailable to me as a course of action.  Not long after that, I decided to use the family spaniel to take me from behind.  The abuser who had been abusing me for much of my life, couldn’t get an erection, at least not hard enough to penetrate me anally.  He had tried once, but couldn’t.  I now put this lack of blood down to the suggestion that he, himself, was possessed with an alter-ego having been built in him, in order to use him as a paedophile; as a weapon.  His surname was McIntyre, which sounds too close to Mull of Kintyre (the angle it descends relative to the canonical direction of South, is taken to be the maximum amount of an erection that should be visible for cultural media to be legal). </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">	I might be wrong, but it is something I add in for the sake of any investigating authority to examine.  Because he couldn’t penetrate me, and because the discussion of homosexuality had surrounded my generation all my life, since I was born in 1971, a year or two after the legalisation of that behaviour, I felt that I wanted to experience anal sex.  I hadn’t for much long before that, and again, I suspect that I was hypnotised, since the thieves needed some secret in me pertaining to something embarrassing and related to sexual behaviour, so that I would look guilty in order to conform to the suspicions of the vigilantes.  Also, it is a feature of the delibidinising poison that the thieves use, that homosexual feelings are more likely to be inspired in the victim, once the victim has been delibidinised.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">	15 years later, perhaps a year before the time that I stood at the top of the steps and told my brother that I would tell others that he was of questionable character, as detailed above, I had a recovered memory of approaching my brother and engaging in sexual molestation, a blowjob to be precise.  It wasn’t real, but was hypnotised, the convolution of the experience that I had when I was younger.  I also recalled a time when I was with my best friend, travelling in Thailand, and to save money on accommodation we slept in the same bed.  I recalled giving my sleeping friend a blowjob.  At about the same time, another friend, who had spent time in India not long before, turned to me and stated ‘who do you consider to be your brother’.  On responding that it was my brother, Richard, he persisted in asking me, and eventually, I submitted and said that my best friend was like a brother to me.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">	That was the thieves letting me know what they were doing.  They don’t expect me to be able to tell others what has been happening, I suspect.  Convincing anyone that false witness can be created in some unsuspecting member of the public is a terrifying thought, particularly in the light of all the ‘peado’ accusations against people like Jimmy Saville and Rolf Harris.  However, I was trained in my degree as an experimental psychologist, so I might be able to produce reproducible effects to demonstrate the existence of these possibilities.  Should they exist, which I am sure they do, then the ethical position is to warn all about their existence, since one can only really defeat hypnotic conditioning if one is aware of it as a potential bias.  The other principal thing to do is to arrive at ‘antidotes’ to prevent the hypnosis.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I have been documenting all of the techniques that I have witnessed as well as an almost complete diary of the events that I have experienced, and also details of the techniques, and my conjecture about the identity of the thieves, on my Facebook wall.  All the posts have been placed publicly, specifically in the hope that an authority might be able to use them to further investigate the subject by examining for other occurrences of it.  Also, as an experimental psychologist, I have witnessed enough of the techniques and have spent enough time reasoning on them to be able to recreate the phenomena in an experimental environment.  This should help both in obtaining better understanding of how to identify and also antidotes for the different techniques.  As I wrote on Facebook, the thieves, at first, attempted to try and use hypnosis in real time to stop me, which I struggled against and, to the best of my ability tried to defeat.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">One of the most difficult techniques that I have had the misfortune to be on the receiving end of, is the use of three month long targeted hypnosis using the results of many studies surrounding Fodor’s modularity of mind.  The experiments and resulting journal articles have informed the filthy hypnotists, how to ‘steer’ cardiovascular resources to one particular ‘module’ in the brain.  They did this for three months at a time across 2016 and part of 2017.  This allows them to construct conditioned sets of behaviour that see the cardiovascular resources trained to two different and incongruent areas in the brain, quite unnaturally.  The thieving hypnotist then triggers the resolution of the cardiovascular resources which collide in the brain causing an enormous cathartic response of aggressive sounding shouting.  With the right conditioning, a panic can be created in the victim.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This was used to great effect, when ambulance staff recently called patronisingly through the letterbox of my front door, and this triggered the rapid cathartic state, in which I was sent into a panic and could not stop shouting.  This was after a similar event had been triggered by the situation of a mental health nurse in a drop in center in front of the door eating a burger.  I had been talking to a friend, a neighbour in fact, about the evils of eating microwave burgers from Iceland, since they have a high sugar content, and she is morbidly obese, the day before.  The potentiated complexes that occur from these prepared events the day before, are then utilised during conditioning whilst asleep. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I visited the diner, a drop in lunch centre, and ate lunch, and as I was leaving, there was a nurse eating a burger, and it triggered the cathartic stress.  I shouted over the top of myself, that I was experiencing hypnosis, and that I was in a deliberately induced cathartic state, and not wanting to leave until I had received some affirmation of recognition of the fact that I was not a danger, but in a temporary state, entered the room with the pool table.  There was safety glass between the pool room and the room with the corridor and open plan kitchen.  Behind the safety glass, the staff and other mental health service users were standing, all of them female.  The safety glass was deliberately placed as an act of hypnosis of the witnesses who would, that night, experience a different memory of the event.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The thieves have certainly been using their techniques to create recovered memories in others.  This has seen Britain beset with claims that well known celebrities are paedophiles, an attack on our good name, but more than that.  Jimmy Saville was someone who was looked up to by many of the poorer members of our society who make up the stock and trade of those who become vigilantes.  The announcement of his crimes came after he had died, and so was unable to defend himself, and the shocking announcement, will have played hard on that bias that exists in the subconscious of the individuals that watched him as a child.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The prevailing image for people who were protestants as children, at least, of Jesus, is one of him ‘suffering the little children’, depicted as them sitting on his knee.  Jimmy Saville is a isomorph of this.  The vigilantes tend to come from working class backgrounds and are the first generation of post Christians, and were brought up as Christians themselves, so they have that image of Jesus, the saviour of the children, that has probably been a prominent part of the Christian narrative since the reformist movements of the 19<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span> century.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Rolf Harris was a person who presented art, that vehicle for political and self expression, to the working and middle classes.  It has been a situation for many years that the young are presented with the opportunity to draw, and when they first try they discover that they don’t have the hand/eye co-ordination to be able to achieve the image that they have in their head.  Their disappointment is never met with an explanation about hand/eye co-ordination, and they are not immediately introduced to devices to help them, such as the camera lucida.  Only art students, much later, get to learn about those things.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This failure, to successfully create the picture on the outside of their head that they have on the inside, is a direct analogue of political action.  Political action is the creation of some reality on the outside that successfully mirrors the picture on the inside, and so this terrible, humiliating let down as the beautiful picture in their head becomes a formless, embarrassing, scribble is enough to distance themselves from any existentially valid situation viz. a viz. politics.  They become the disaffected. Rolf Harris turned this around, and much of the peace and quiet in society over the last thirty years has been consequential to his programmes, I greatly suspect.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Along with Tony Hart, the people had art, it became their expression.  They haven’t had that sudden burst of freedom of expression since the Cathedrals and Churches were whitewashed during the reformation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This last observation introduces me to a final point that I need to make.  The thieves have been slowly cultivating in others an image of me as a messianic narcissist.   At least some of the content of the earlier, health oriented part of this book was brought about in order to add to this image.  I feel that conjecture is never really idle, it all adds to the potential of insight that is valuable.  A wrong idea is better than no idea, it is like the saying better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it, a sort of metaphor I guess.  Not everyone agrees, and the rise of the right wing is seeing extremism funding the loss of ability to make out with clarity the actions of the thieves, which is precisely why they are engaging in encouraging the right wing to rise.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">What the thieves have been trying to do with the victims that they start on when they are younger, I suspect, has to do either with those victims being drawn from a pool of people who are from one side of a family, where two brothers are culturally coerced into being a Cain and an Abel type, and the Cain type is promoted whilst the thieves attack the Abel.  They then attack their children and their children’s children. This is partly because they are removing the British aristocracy and partly, I suspect, because they are engaging in inheritance theft, specifically by preventing the individuals from having children, which then leaves the property going to auction, eventually.  The thieves, experts in hypnosis, then control the outcome of the auction through suggestion techniques.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Also, the creative intellect of a child from an educated family can be stimulated through sexual abuse, in that normally, where the child would pick up on learning from any source, through mimetic internalisation i.e. copying, an abused child sees the isomorphic similarity between a teacher and an adult inserting things into them, and this interrupts the flow of cardiovascular resources to their brains, leaving them in a situation that interrupts the mimetic transfer of information.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">In order to keep up with the others, they are then forced to create explicit sotto voce narratives to describe, in some model form, the learning that they are undertaking.  The continuous sotto voce modelling of the environment, leaves them becoming very rehearsed at thinking.  My cranium has shrunk, since my continuous sotto voce narrative throughout my life has left me with no fat there at all.  The consequence eventually becomes that of one where the tantric interrogation can be utilised meaningfully by these sexual-molestation-created adepts.  One can see the ridges on either side of my smaller cranium.  The American program, Star Trek refers to them as Klingon ridges.  And we, the victims, are often clingy.  The consequence of the molestation leaves us thinking more, and never being seen for our intellect as we develop attentional deficits, which serve to interfere with our schooling.  I discuss more about this in appendix C, in which I detail some of my experiences as a victim/survivor of CSA.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The thieving bastards, apprehending that I am going to be writing about my experiences of loneliness at Victoria college, when a student there, have brought two speakers about loneliness to give a talk a Victoria College.   So, when I write about the loneliness, in the next appendix, an attempt will be made to convince readers that I simply heard about the talk on loneliness at Victoria College and then made up the part about loneliness at Victoria College in the section following this one.  This is one of many, many techniques to try and lay the way for later psychological or psychiatric insults to try and prevent others from realising that this book’s description of neuropsychology with its focus on the neural system’s role in biasing the cardiovascular system,  is quite correct in it presumptions.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">They attack the proponents of this theory, hoping to silence them, because they use these insights in order to control people hypnotically, and with the set of anti-psychotics, that are a simple case of fraud, that just block the liver up in preparation for driving the victim mad, as well as the fact that the medical science of pharmaceuticals is undoubtedly manufactured on shaky premises, and false conclusions, they maintain their power.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I often use the term ‘chain of fools’ for these thieves, as they are using hypnosis to motivate others to do their dirty work.  Their ‘tools’ are individuals who, for some reason or other, are likely to engage in activity against some individual in a way that they cannot speak openly about.  The right wing, for instance, practise forms of behaviour that are specifically constrained into an unspoken, unwritten, silent agreement, by the public image of the left wing, who write everything openly and accountability is one of their founding features.  So, as the right wing have risen, which is a process that has been occurring slowly over the last 30 or more years, they have been used to attack the victims of theft.  Because the right wing ‘tools’ are engaging in activity that is silent and not publishable openly, the thieves can use them to their hearts content, without ever fearing that they might be investigated.  The tools become the smokescreen.  The rise of obvious right wing power recently, by the way, is as a consequence of the isomorphy that exists between a united Europe, and Roman Catholicism, which, as a practice is the only one that finds itself isomorphic with European political solidarity, and is also ‘behind the scenes’ with no demonstrable act of justification, as an act of faith, isomorphic with right wing behaviour.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">So, if you have read the chapter on paranoia, you will know that the psyche-logic underlying any conscious justification for paranoia, is often, especially in the case of nefarious use, a situation where the individual can’t get closure to some issue.  In certain situations, I maintain, a situation where the individual is experiencing attentional resource shortage, such as during mental health issues, leaves the individual becoming addicted to the potential automatic attentional focus of the paranoid experience.  Many addictions are due to the substance commanding an immediate automatic attentional focus.  In doing so, they appeal to stressed brains which suddenly get attentional focus amidst the chaos they normally experience.  Cognitive economy sees the induced attentional focus as a form of systemic redundancy, where the brain suddenly seems to have the spare time to relax.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal"> But in any case whether or not the individual experiences mental health issues, once the scumbags have implied into existence the requirement to pay attention to a potential threat, that the victim cannot obtain closure to, they will remain alert to the potential danger.  So, enter stage right, whisper campaigns, the silent treatment, being sent to Coventry etc etc.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The scumbags have taken this, literally, to an art form, as they know that their victim will be aroused by any isomorph of what has happened, so, they the use their influence, most likely hypnotically, on script writers and producers and directors, as well as authors, and make certain that there is an implied isomorph in the beginning of some film/book/play etc that will then elicit the fight/flight complex in the individual who hasn't been able to get closure, and then they can put an implied isomorph into the film etc that only the victim will be able to perceive.  This then, resolving around then victim's ego complex at that moment, leaves them reporting 'hearing messages’ coming from the TV etc.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-weight:normal">Medications for mental health episodes generally, are unhealthy and unnecessary, but particularly in the case of paranoia, and only serve to brook dissent in the patient, as the pain that they cause is extremely debilitating, and seems to be purposefully so.  The thieves do not care about the smokescreen of mental health patients who are compliant.  They only care that there are more of them than the minority of individuals in that situation that they are torturing, specifically to prepare them for the period of interrogation, without them being spotted.  Before the ‘interrogation’ began, I was taken off the painful drugs and placed on Quetiapine, that does not cause pain.  This left me unlikely to contact anyone about what was happening during the interrogation, as I did not want to risk going back onto some painful regime of ‘medications’.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">With regards to medication, there are a couple of weeks after some period of stress that might find medication justified, but even this will become less and less necessary as we move away from the last war, and the consequent trauma and it's consequences for culture.  Yet the genetic argument, which is utter rubbish, undoubtedly influences models of diagnosis and prescription, to the extent that every mental health patient is worth their weight in gold, at least in terms of the lifetime of mental health medications that they will be using.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">One of the ways in which the thieves are hoping to prevent me from raising help from an authority is the way in which they are planning to control my image when I get to Britain to attempt to raise help from an authority.  They have presented me with no end of characters in my life, including people that I know, as well as psychiatric and other medical staff, that have names that could be have been plucked out of a hat, and that are rather stupid in one way or another.  The names have been designed so that when I get to the UK, they can order a psychiatric interview of me, and in the course of mentioning my neighbour, the taxi driver, Phil Mitchell, as well as my former CPN, Andy Bear (the man who molested me was called Andy), the locum psychiatrist Dr James, the endocrinologist Dr Alias, Dr Judit Somalie (a name that relates to some of the historical observations that I have made – that the Jews might claim that the Somme was a lie, when actually I had claimed it -this won’t mean much out of context but is specifically for the investigating psychiatrist in the UK), the surgeon Dr Tehran (who operated on my foot, preventing me from running), the psychiatrist Dr Kurryan (korean), along with a whole host of other names.  These names would reflect some image of insanity, as though I were making it up.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I am relatively certain that this technique is going to be augmented by a corrupt line of communication between the island and the UK.  Recently, when I announced publicly that I was coming off the quetiapine, a number of techniques were used to paint a picture of me as mentally ill requiring treatment.  Eventually, after the event with the burger eating nurse at the diner, and some rigged police meetings, I was accosted at my flat by police and placed under an article.  I had just returned from doing some carpentry at my mother’s house, when I parked my car, and noticed a hire car, which shouldn’t have been in the car park of my housing estate.  I approached the car and in it was a man about my age, perhaps younger, who was of African origin.  I asked him if he knew that it was a private car park, and he said yes, he knew all too well that it was private, as if to imply something.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I left him there and then went back to my flat.  A little later, an ambulance pulled up outside the block of flats in which I live, and before long a female paramedic called through the letterbox in a patronising voice.  As she did so, an enormous cathartic episode, conditioned in to me the previous night(s), erupted, the trained incompatible ‘modules’ of the mind suddenly resolving through a filter of conditioned stress relating to the suggestion that I should shout about going to war or similar, to defend myself.  I recall strutting backwards and forwards in my flat, waving part of a microphone stand whilst shouting.  It was not me, it was conditioned.  The police were called, and arrived almost immediately.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">There were, as usual, 7 of them, I think the number has something to do with group relations when adjusting their memory for events.   It may also have something to do with group cohesiveness and conditioning, as whilst they were outside I opened the door and showed one of them a post that had just arrived on Facebook on my wall, with a comic strip of a policeman arriving.  As I took the tablet computer from the policeman to put it back in my flat, there was a call from the back of the huddle by a darker skinned policeman (southern European), who shouted ‘do not let him get back in’.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This triggered the police into assaulting me, with four of them jumping on me through the doorway of my flat.   I found myself biting one of them, again a conditioned behaviour, from having recounted an episode in which an ex-girlfriend had bitten someone.  They put me into a headlock with my hands cuffed in one of those hand restraints without a chain between the cuffs, which is little more than a torture device designed to damage the nerves of the wrists, and then almost strangled me to death on the steps on the way down, where they couldn’t be seen for at least half the steps.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">If I had not shouted that that was what they were doing, then I greatly suspect that I wouldn’t be here now.  They were certainly conditioned.  I am sure of this because it was behaviour that was certainly outside of requirements and certainly outside of professional behaviour.  I am certain that as they encounter these conditioned episodes of violence, they are unaware that they are being hypnotised and are then rationalising the event according to whatever group dynamic affords them the opportunity to explain it.  This is undoubtedly how the death squads of the 1930s started in Germany, and in Chile in the 70s etc...</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Whilst in Orchard house, I wrote a statement about the behaviour of the police and about the thieves and their use of the mental hospital.  I also found myself facing an attempt to hypnotise me by a corrupt mental health nurse, and was also conditioned whilst I slept with targeted ECT.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Some months later, towards the beginning of September 2019, I called the clinic to obtain a strip of medication, one had gone missing from my flat.  The clinic now require the duty psychiatrist to see the individual before they prescribe.  So, I went to the clinic, and there I met Dr O’Kiki, who was supposed to be the psychiatrist outside my flat, when I was placed under an article (sectioned). That psychiatrist, who had told me that his name was Dr O’Kiki, was a shorter man, and he wore glasses around his neck on a chain.  This was definitely not the psychiatrist that I had met when I was placed under and article.  I left without saying anything as my father was waiting in the car outside.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I couldn’t imagine why this should be the case.  At first I wondered if I had been framed in some way, the process of putting me under article being faked.  But then I realised that it was more likely that the fact that the guy who was outside my flat, posing as the psychiatrist, was wearing glasses around his neck on a chain, was most likely to do with some attempt to bring my testimony into question by suggesting that my memory was flawed.  My regular psychiatrist has recently taken over my care as my original psychiatrist has taken a sabbatical.  The name of my new psychiatrist is Dr O’Brady-Henry and she is also of African origin and she wears glasses around her neck on a chain, from memory.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I am relatively certain that the medical records would be faked, caught in transition between the island and the UK and then fed to the waiting psychiatrist in the UK that would be ‘investigating’ me, and doctored to change the name of the attending psychiatrist from Dr O’Kiki to Dr O’Brady-Henry.  Hence why two new psychiatrists both with surnames starting with O’ and both of them of African origin.  Anyway, the fact that the are both black would most likely be used by the investigating psychiatrist to suggest that I was confabulating my memory as a consequence of some racial stress.  The thieves like to make you into your own worst enemy, as I am as far from being a racist as I can  possibly manage.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The conditioning techniques had been used powerfully, to drive a wedge between my brother and I and to also stop me from going to France with my father.  When in France, at my dad’s house, a sudden cathartic conditioning was triggered, that saw me panicking and shouting.  This was done to me several times, until my father couldn’t bear to take me any more.  It was my only holiday, and was quality time with my dad, and also with my brother.  The final time, the thieving scum had me shouting terrible things about my brother, to the extent that my brother no longer talks to me at all.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">There are many other incidents that I have experienced that I should relate, and hopefully will get the chance to at some point in the future, in the form of a statement for an investigating authority.  My plan currently is to take this document with the statement about the use of the mental hospital and police etc, and try and make an approach to the House of Lords via one of the Lords.  I will need to go to Britain, and spend some time making that approach.  The thieves are preparing for me to arrive, and hence all of the silly names etc.  It is my suspicion that they, the thieves, have almost exclusive control over Britain currently, through hypnosis, amongst other techniques.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Having been on the receiving end of at least some of these techniques, I should be able to recreate them in an experimental setting, in order to provide empirical support and evidence.  At least that is true of the psychological incidents, but there were many different incidents of attempted ‘thought control’ i.e. conditioned suggestion or image-control, where poisons were used to render me more susceptible. One technique that was used on me, for instance, was to spike my food or drink with what I suspect is a heavy metal, like lead, lithium or mercury.  The consequence of the weight of this material is that it gathered intra-cranially in troughs of the cardiovascular venous system, which then formed micro valves.  These micro-valves would allow the pressure of directed blood to build up behind them, and would then ‘explode’, leaving a rush of blood so that the foveated neural complex would experience a sudden blood pressure that would shift the point of foveation to a position on the same neural complex but an exaggerated form of it.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Whether the movement was actually spatial in terms of the movement of the pressurised blood, or simply that the feeling associated with this sudden ‘explosion’ of blood was one of aggression, or whether the feeling of aggression would be associated with the sudden need to catharcise the expression of this blood pressurized neural complex, I cannot tell.  That is for investigatory neuropsychology, perhaps using FMRI, although one has to consider the ethical implications of such a thing.  The ultimate end of that technique was to encourage the belief in some audience, if not in the victim himself, that the victim was prone to aggression.  My point in this paragraph is to point out that, due to ethical concerns, not all the techniques employed by the thieves will be able to be reproduced under experimental conditions.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The thieves made a habit, for the first few years, of asking what I thought was happening, at which point, with some rather negative forms of encouragement, I would eventually, launch into a likely explanation of what physical underpinnings of psychological processes, were occurring.  My explanation, a pseudo explanation, like much of this book, since I can’t currently offer empirical support for its insights, will have been examined by the thieves with regard to its ability, as an explanation, to use to bullshit other victims, and/or the general public generally.  So, for the last two hundred years, and much more, the thieves have been confronting victims using hypnosis, and then listening to their explanations as to what is happening.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Before science and the enlightenment, the experience was most likely framed in terms of God, or the Devil, etc, but since the enlightenment, the nascent scientists and natural philosophers have been making naive descriptions of what they thought has been happening and more importantly, how it has been happening.  In the case of anyone with any knowledge of psychology or neuroscience, and/or anyone with knowledge of electronics and telecommunications technology, the victim has informed the thieves about other techniques that might work to achieve the same end.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">This has lead to the thieves having a number of different technologies that they are able to use, and to the thieves having access to many different stories of what is happening, that they are able to use as a smoke screen by encouraging the victim to believe one or another form of nonsense.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Amongst these techniques, are a certain set of them where the thieves attempt to convince the victim of their identity.  Many, many, attempts were made to encourage me to believe that the thieves were American, English, or Irish, Jewish or Catholic, and the Royal Family was often ‘in the frame’, with suggestion attempting to achieve an anti-monarchist sentiment in myself.  The mafia was frequently blamed amongst other stereotypes that have been ‘massaged’ into our culture using films depicting them.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I know from experience that the mafia are simply an honorary police, whose principle task was to defend Christian (Roman Catholic) law, and who were part of the paraphernalia of the Papal states.  When the Papal states started to come to an end and be replaced by the large nations of Europe that we are familiar with now, the mafias started going to war, to defend the papal states, and to fund themselves became involved with crime.  The images of the mafia in America have been of post European soldiers returning to America, from the first world war, so traumatised that in their passionate Southern European frame of mind, they carried that trauma and violence into their businesses and their criminal activities.  I am prone to over simplification as much as I am to over-complification, but one thing that I am certain of is that honour cultures do not employ the tactics that I have been on the receiving end of.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I traced the history of the thieves back and found that all roads seemed to lead toward Northern India, their position of the trade routes offering them a sufficient amount of economic control, for them to use psychological ‘warfare’ effectively, to build empires and then control their destruction, whilst stealing the academics.  In the case of the European empires, including Britain, academics had been swept through poverty and revolution, down through Russia, into Poland and Germany, and then to the Netherlands, at about the time of William of Orange, and then into France for the French revolution, before arriving in Britain, where they had already been working on ‘setting the scene’ as they prepared to take our academics.  In preparation for taking Britain, they entered Spain during the Moorish conquest, and then Ireland through the Armada, and, as partition occurred, they spent their time encouraging the Irish against the British.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The details are laborious.  Once you can account for their influence, though, a whole host of events begin to make a lot more sense than they did before.  However, there are so many of them that I’m loathe to go into detail here, reserving it for a separate book on the subject at some point in the future.  It should make interesting reading, as one can trace their techniques back through George 3<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">rd</span>, to Louis 14<span style="font-size:58%;vertical-align:super">th</span>, to Edward the confessor, back to classical Rome, and beyond to antiquity.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">Finally, across the course of time that I have been resisting the thieves, from 2010 onwards, I have witnessed many people being murdered in a manner that has been designed so that I can relate it to my situation.  In each case, the murder has been conducted so that I will be able to relate it to my own situation.  It is an attempt to induce fear, and discreditation if I speak out about it.  My flat is in that building that I propose has been designed for purpose, and next door is a block of flats called ‘St Helier House’ which has the same cladding as Joyce Grenfell building in London.  When the building burnt, it was, with its burning upper floors related to me that it was a nuclear missile that had landed, and that it was when I chose Grainville school, when I left public school, and not some other.   Sent Hell Here House, Choice Grainville.  The linguistic plays on words appeal to the individual with a loosened attentional complex, which is generally where victims find themselves, and the thieves encourage the victim to believe one mythological suggestion or another as to the genesis of those linguistic plays on words.  They are communications from another dimension.  They are animals communicating, or spirits.  They are the ‘word of God’, etc.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">It is difficult for any person without experience in these areas of mental health, either as people who experience, or health professionals who study the area, to appreciate the type of complex justifications and explanations that the thieves were attempting to coerce into my self explanation, as they attempted to drive me insane.  The thieves did this thing, as they had planned, in order to get me to try and relate the experience, shocked by all the deaths, to the point at which I would be discredited, as no one would be able to understand the complex and mythological explanatory framework that the thieves had been attempting to develop in me.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">There were many other deaths, Adrian Lynch (presented as a reference to Adrian Fowler – whom I had just met) locally, David Miller in Thailand, Paul Miller locally, Adrian Fowler, Aaron Pinwell, and others, that were all related to my situation in some praxis based manner, designed to scare me, or to force me to talk openly, in order to discredit me.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">During the interrogation, I remained cynical and reasonably lucid, through being able to understand, through my model of consciousness, how the thieves were working me over.  However, I couldn’t bring myself to approach the authorities, although I did, at first, but was too deeply ensconced in the consequences of having my liver unblocked.  At no point did I dare state to the psychiatric team, either the Psychiatrist or my CPN, about what was happening in any detail.  This was stimulated by the terrible fear that I had about being readmitted to the psychiatric institution.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">I had spent about 8 years, prior to the interrogation commencing, being literally tortured in the mental hospital, the use of anti-psychotic medications, often depot injections, that left me itching on the inside, drooling, with my leg stamping, the very illusion of a dog, for the sake of convincing others should I relate the issue, that they should point towards their stereotype of some elitist, schadenfreude set of individuals that are the ‘cause’, when, in fact, it is some thieves.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal">The terrible pain of this situation was made worse through the use of sleeping medication that, in my opinion, was deliberately prescribed for the purpose of inducing lack of sleep, and the psychological torture that it incurs.  Zolpidem Nitrate, was prescribed, which has a recommended usage time of no longer than 2 weeks yet this drug was prescribed for well over 6 months for many people, including myself. The consequence of the prolonged use, was that we accommodated to the drug, which would then leave us experiencing a painful type of sleep deprivation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">	The thieves worked to hide the evidence of their existence.  A number of times over the last couple of years (2019 now), I visited my doctor, and an endocrinologist that he referred me to.  When a blood test was approaching that was designed to measure testosterone levels, I would find myself in a situation where I began to experience observable effects of testosterone increase.  My general ability to look after my flat, doing the housework etc, would increase, my sleep would improve.  I would start sweating from under my arms with that ‘tangy’ olfactory profile that is characteristic of a healthy male sweat.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Once the blood test had been taken, I would find myself delibidinised, with the flat becoming messy, and the sweat disappearing.  Erectile dysfunction would set in, having been alleviated briefly.  In case I haven’t mentioned it before, the delibidinisation of the victim by the police, or vigilantes, whichever are doing it (I suspect both), leaves the testosterone deprived individual more susceptible to exogenous cues, i.e. biases on their behaviour.  The victim then becomes more lascivious, more drawn by temptations, and this becomes a self fulfilling prophecy for the vigilante force, who then ‘treat’ the victim further, until the victim is utterly drained, psychologically, by the vigilante action.   </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The psychiatrists follow a model of medicating people for life, when there really is no good evidence that a person requires medication for any period of time excepting that time when they are experiencing the heightened stress.  The thieves make certain that their victim is kept on medication.  So, after I was attacked with the handheld ultrasound device, I realised, as my health deteriorated, that the quetiapine lowers blood pressure, something that was undoubtedly unhealthy in the aftermath of damage to my heart.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">So, I slowly came off the medication, knowing from previous experience that one of the ‘tricks’ of mental health is that the ‘anti psychotics’ implicate themselves in the chain of precursors of an individual the point at which the individual accommodates to them.  Once accommodated to them, if the individual stops suddenly, then there are effectively, ‘withdrawal’ symptoms, and, since these concern the precursors, the individual who experiences coming off these insidious ‘medications’ finds themselves experiencing psychotic symptoms.  To give you an idea of the insidious and utterly aggressive stupidity of these ‘medications’, if one wishes to alleviate the psychotic symptoms of ‘withdrawal’, one needs to spend no less than 18 months slowly removing the drug from one’s physiology.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Most psychiatrists were withdrawing people according to Maudsley prescribing guides or similar, across the course of several months, which is far too quick.  Around the time that I was first attacked in 2009, psychiatrists were taking people off their medication regimes immediately, with no period of withdrawal.  These idiot psychiatrists had, and have, become motivated by some utilitarian concern that ethically ‘allows’ them to engage in behaviours that are maladaptive to the individual, imagining themselves, I presume, in a ‘vigilante’ role, making certain that their patient, who they imagine to be ‘at risk’ no matter what the life circumstances of the patient are, will immediately become psychotic, allowing them, the psychiatrist, to encourage the patient’s confidence in them.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">At no time should any serious professional practice a ‘con’ such as this.  It is disgusting, but that is psychiatry generally.  The cheapest ‘cure’ without spending any real money on the victim’s circumstance, social or home or otherwise.  Anyway, after the attack using what I presume to have been a handheld ultrasound, my physiology and cognition both slowed down, and I started to experience neuropathy, so I slowly withdrew from the quetiapine, and for the first time in years, started exercising.  I went to the gym two or three times a week for several years, before joining the ‘exercise referral scheme’.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I remained healthy, psychologically, throughout this period, although, when at home, thinking out loud, as I had been trained and as I still do.  Then, after I was healthy and past the difficult physiological consequences of that attack, I approached the psychiatrist about coming off the medication.  We agreed on a withdrawal program, and at this point, once I had publicly started coming off the medication, the thieves began to attack me, as I detail in the statement that I am working on separately.  They would not leave me alone, making certain that I was publicly humiliated and was treated in that way that I have mentioned earlier, where I was conditioned with two incongruent, Fodoristic (as in Modularity of Mind – Jerry Fodor) modules, end points for the cardiovascular system, so that the adrenals were kept in a situation where they would support blood forced to these two incongruent places, which were then allowed to collapse by triggering a conditioned routine that would allow the blood to collapse, the incongruently created psychological correlates of those endpoints of cardiovascular pressure leading to an emotive, aggressive looking, catharcis of the suddenly implied stress.  I could not prepare for this, and found it being created twice, once when I was at a drop in centre for lunch, and once when the police were outside my flat.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">From the time that the interrogation began, all the point light sources at night, became the same shape as the Nativity star, depicted over the cradle of the baby Jesus, since, I suspect, the invention of electricity in the 18</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.826668px;vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px"> century.  That one of the first uses was to torture peasants, may sit well with your picture of some De Sadean elite, but I greatly suspect that it simply augmented and improved some pre-existing technique, perhaps with good priest, bad priest, (not that they were priests in reality), where bad priest would hit the individual across the face with a bible.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Later, after the same conditioning experience was triggered, faces in pictures began to move to look at me, if I willed it.  I have had the uncanny experience of willing a statue to turn and face me, as well as many pictures.  It is a consequence I think of the way in which the brain performs a feat called ‘viewpoint invariant representation’.  The brain is able to present the continuation of perceived features in a manner that is similar to the observed phenomenon of seeing a human face mask in relief being presented as perceptually intaglio (opposite of ‘in relief’).  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">This phenomenon, and the likelihood that it might more frequently occur when a person is more impulsive due to having less cardiovascular resources available, such as when they are hot and sweaty, and perhaps due to that and the widespread incidence of cannabis in North Africa, is perhaps the reason why the depiction of human faces is proscribed against in Islamic art.<br /></span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">There is a final point that I should make that concerns many people in Britain, as the thieves destroy the fabric of our society, attacking us in many ways, conniving as they go, to suggest that it is simply an attack motivated by ‘revenge’.  The thieves created in Britain, the East India Trading Company, for the sake of pursuing the ability to suggest that their attack on us was motivated by a desire for revenge.  They bankrupted the Holy Roman Empire in its pursuit for Americas, using them after their collapse as tools to attack students etc.  They hypnotised George 3</span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.826668px;vertical-align:super">rd, </span><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">who potentially shows signs of having been ‘possessed’ - the fat on the face, and body, begins to redistribute itself to that serving the ‘alter-ego’.  I have other, more modern, examples of the phenomenon, but that relate to living people, so I will leave them out from this writing.</span></p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">So, as the thieves continue to cement their power in Britain, they pursue the act of theft of inheritance, by using Cain and Abel, as detailed above and other strategies to funnel an inheritance in to single hands before murdering this individual or marrying them, or leaving no issue (children), and then exploiting the design of the church with pulpit, and the cultural impression that that has created, to successfully hypnotically control auctions.  The homes, I suspect, are slowly rewarded, increasingly, to perfectly innocent members of the ‘Asian’ community, encouraging an increase of support for arriving Asians.  This is because the thieves have the strongest and longest hold over Asia, it being the centre of trade routes.  Those Asians, introduce, both memetically, and theoretically, genetically, biases that leave the culture generally leaving the inhabitants more susceptible to hypnosis.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I have observed that the thieves seem to be attacking a wide and diverse group of people, and tend to make ‘stories’ that will allow them, the thieves, to use these ‘stories’ to play us off one another as victims.  The thieves utilise one victim as the prop in the construction of some ‘story’ that will see some other victim come to harm.   My friend, who lost his house to one of these thieves, and I had a fight at school, for example.  The fight between ourselves was deliberately organised, I suspect, as by that time it had been ascertained that I would be used as a prop in his ‘story’ as his inherited house was stolen.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">One of the features of their attack on Britain, in this insidious manner, is the creation of paedophiles.  The thieves have realised, at some point, that the accusation of paedophilia against some individual is so traumatic that it certainly forms a lasting traumatic bias.  The thieves exploit this by damaging the cardiovascular efficiency of the victim as the accusation is made, leaving the victim in a situation where they are less able to maintain endogenous control of the exogenous bias of the traumatic accusation.  This results in the individual making a self-accusation, which is reinforced in its likeliness of being made, by introducing the victim to the notion ‘that the abused abuse’.  The continuous existence of this traumatic bias, created by the accusation, is entirely compounded by the worse, more traumatic, self accusation, where the self accusation is encouraged in a number of ways by the thieves.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">As I describe above, towards the end of my degree, the woman who had had her daughter take me around the garden and shout at me, then poisoned me with bismuth schellate, which damages the tone of the cardiovascular system.  This resulted in leaving me with less endogenous attentional control with regard to the exogenous cue of the continuous traumatically intrusive bias created by the accusation, that was not stated so much as implied, by her daughter, and then, following that, reinforced by the sudden silent treatments of my friends.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I was on my own, when I returned to University, in a year surrounded by no-one that I knew, and I had been given such a bad taste for shared accommodation by tenants almost certainly associated with the thieves, and most likely purposefully, to make certain that I would, from then on, live on my own.  I started fishing to deal with the loneliness, and one day, as I was walking along the long pier that stretches in to the Plymouth Sound, I realised that I’d left my fishing tackle quite some way back on the pier, and in my sotto voce, I stated ‘you stupid kiddy fiddler’.  This self accusation which was entirely traumatic, left me vowing to find out what was happening, and left me, from then on, avoiding any contact with children, even crossing the road to avoid any suspicion being brought on their shoulders, let alone on mine.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I hypothesise that there are a number of individuals who have allowed the self accusation and the traumatic bias that it creates, continuously pressure them in a way that leaves the stress of diminished endogenous control allowing exogenous control to pass through that mimetic barrier that is involved in internalising other’s behaviour when learning.  The individual then internalises the conceptual definition and eventually, is driven to engage in the crime of paedophilia as a matter of catharsis of stress, rationalising the crime in some way that is consistent with their self.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I overcame the traumatic bias and its effects, through reasoning and through an awareness of psychology.  I knew, for instance, that the bias, when it occurred, was a result of my experiences, and not some lasting component of my self.   Later, up until 2009, I found myself feeling accused when in the company of certain individuals that I associated with vigilantes, often, according to the stereotyped expectations created by experience, working class individuals.  I could hear the intrusive accusation in my mind, which I knew then, as now, to be my thoughts.  I reasoned that my own stereotyping of others was leaving the traumatic memory of accusation primed to intrude into consciousness when presented with some person or people that matched the stereotype that I had built of vigilantes.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">There are less healthy rationalisations others arrive at, I suspect, including ‘hearing voices’ etc.  The continuous stress of the interrogation left the traumatic cycle of accusation diminishing, but most likely because, when the interrogation began, I was finally able to understand the cause of all the preceding events, and so the initial cause of the traumatic cycle was answered, and this left the traumatic cycle diminishing, and effectively ending.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent"><span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">We are, as selves, at one level, the summation of what other’s think of us, particularly what our friends think of us.  I have yet to find out how my friends rationalised their silent treatment of me, even now, almost twenty years later.  There can be no stronger self doubt, than the doubt of our self by our peers, particularly when we are victims of child abuse, sexual or otherwise, since we consequently find ourselves making less strong associations with our parents, due to the cognitive isomorphy of the adult abuser, with the adult that is the parent.  We become far more motivated by our friends, than our family.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The mimetic barrier is how normal learning occurs, if you haven’t read my book, or if I have forgotten to include it.  Normally, a child learns from an adult by copying their behaviour.  In most cases, they inhibit their own behaviour in the process, sitting still, whilst they watch the adult.  In victims of abuse, this is different, since the cognitive isomorphy between the adult abuser inserting something or other, and the teacher, adult and inserting words into their head, is so much that the victim often, if not always, I suspect, does not internalise, not learning mimetically, instead intellectualising and forming explicit models of social behaviour, to navigate, for example, the social environment.  The raped child is intellectualised.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">So in the case of the accused individual, they are so continuously stressed that they allow the accusation to be internalised, in that mimetic sense that learning occurs.  I greatly suspect that the old adage ‘the abused abuse’ is far less likely than the description ‘the accused abuse’.   This is really important to verify, since the vigilantes, at least some of them, are openly accusing the victims, to see how they respond, as a matter of investigating potential guilt.  In doing so, they create the peadophile.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">My investigation into materialist psychology that inspired this book, began when I started my degree in Psychology, although I was beginning to read around the subject long before I had arrived there.  It is a coincidence that the techniques of the thieves can be illuminated by an analysis of materialist psychology.  It is something like, if I hadn’t undertaken the analysis, separately, then I would not be here now.  I estimate that many thousands of former students per annum are consigned indefinitely to the halls of mental asylums and homeless hostels, having been discarded following their ‘interrogation’.  I had the social support, the enduring care of both of my parents, the financial support from my father to tide me over, friends, and many other variables, including living in a reasonably small, close knit community in a small island, Jersey, in the Channel Islands.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The thieves are using techniques that they have either established based on observations of elicited effects, or based upon theoretical insights that they have stolen from students, over the many thousands of years that these thieves have been operating.  Materialist psychological analysis can shed light upon any human phenomenon, let alone the machinations of some thieves.  It is important to acknowledge that this is true, as I have to fend of the allegation that my work that I present in this book is simply a ‘schizotypal confabulation’.  The thieves have designed the mental health system quite carefully to allow them to steal without interruption, and each and every student that is to be stolen from, during interrogation, is treated to the discrediting, humiliating and extremely painful incarceration in a mental hospital prior to the interrogation.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">With regards to the hypnosis used by the thieves, I can allege for instance, that the thieves are engaging in a form of hypnosis, where they use targetted ECT to create a known bias in a known ‘shape’ neurally, and then create some props in the environment of the victim the day, or some days, before some trained behaviour is to be triggered.  The props are arranged so that they overlay the neural bias, isomorphically, and then neural sublimation as the individual sleeps, finds the recall of the inhibited response to the props, ‘coalescing’ together, into a resulting triggerable bias.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The observation that I make, is based upon the experiences that I have had, but interpreted in terms of the underlying mechanism, in the light of my materialist model.  However, there can be no certain level of confidence applied to my observations as they are simply circumstantial evidence.  Hence I hope that there will be some investigation, empirically, of these phenomenon.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">It is of prime importance to concern research with the task of establishing diagnostic markers of the techniques used by the criminals.  In the case of targeted ECT, for example, it should be possible to be able to spot damage to the venous system subserving the extra occular muscles, or to the neural structures directly behind the temples.  In order to prevent the use of targeted ECT, which, I believe, is mostly conducted when we are asleep, it should be recommended to the general public that they should put something heavy behind their bedroom door at night.  As almost all bedroom doors open inwards, and because the theives leave no evidence of their incursion, they should not be able to open the bedroom door, and then close it behind themselves, as well as move whatever item has been left behind the door. Reasonably heavy items that are on spikes are a good idea, perhaps themed in some way for children to use, as the spikes prevent the theif from dragging the object back to its resting place behind the door, when they leave.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Research that will establish the possibility that a cognitive bias formed, whilst the cardiovascular system is impacted, will exert a greater exogenous cue.  Likewise, research should be conducted that establishes whether or not delibidinisation leaves a person more inclined to an opinion or some other feature of the complete environment (which includes their physiological environment) that was present immediately before that person was delibidinised.  This might sound difficult from an ethical point of view, but delibidinisation can be entirely temporary.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Research should be conducted into the markers of childhood sexual abuse, so that children can be spotted as soon as possible as victims of CSA, so that they can be shadowed or otherwise observed sufficient to spot the abuser.  They, the affected children, should be offered the non invasive treatment, EMDR.  I discuss the possibility of the existence of some markers of CSA at the end of the following appendix.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="page-break-before:always;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:bold;font-size:24.0px"><a id="a918AppendixD"></a>Appendix D:<span style="font-weight:normal"> My own experiences of the consequences of 	sexual abuse, seen through the lens of materialist 	psychology.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:bold;font-size:18.666668px"><span style="font-weight:normal">In this last appendix, I want to list some of the consequences of sexual abuse that I have lived with, and an examination of them in the light of materialist psychology, so that I can empower clinicians and therapists with these insights to better understand the situation of at least some victims/survivors.  My experiences won’t extend to describe all victims, just the few in similar situations to myself.  My experiences are those of a male child, and a particular child, not one representative of every background.  I come from an upper class family, sort of, my mother, according to her father, married below her station.  </span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:bold;font-size:18.666668px"><span style="font-weight:normal">I didn’t brush my teeth from my earliest memories, spitting out the toothpaste, and not brushing.  The toothbrush and toothpaste, is isomorphic with the unpleasant experience of a penis shoved in your mouth.  This consequence that I experienced, is, I think, probably common often to victims of CSA.  This is why I am listing it and other consequences, so that rather than vigilantes attempting to catch the wrong doers, with the exception of the entrapment technique employed by Cheyenne O’Connor, a local to the island where I live, the professionals, and the public can be better informed about how to spot the victims, so that they can hear from them who the abuser is.  And, of course, administer EMDR to ensure the victim stops experiencing the attentional interference of the traumatic complexes.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:bold;font-size:18.666668px"><span style="font-weight:normal">There are many presuppositions that surround the issue of child sexual abuse, most of which are entirely incorrect.  One of these is that the abuse abuse.  The consequence for the victim of this paranoid fantasy is roughly explained by the childhood phrase concerning farting.  He who smelt it dealt it.  He who said the rhyme did the crime.  It is the best way that I can think to utterly besmirch the stupid and revoltingly incorrect foundational axiom of the paranoid witch hunt that has been occurring for at least the duration of my life, and not just my adult one.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:bold;font-size:18.666668px"><span style="font-weight:normal">Don’t get me wrong, I was left with serious side effects of the terrible behaviour of this lousy bastard, but when the abuser finished, the rest of society started.  I went from being required to suck a sausage now and again, to be being brutally bullied, poisoned repeatedly, and forced into committing suicide many times over.   The worst thing is that for the entire duration of the horror that has been my adult life, none of it really got worse than it was at school.  This wasn’t always the case.  I started school at Victoria College, a male only public school (private school for those unacquainted with English), having attended Victoria College Preparatory School.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:bold;font-size:18.666668px"><span style="font-weight:normal">At Victoria College Preparatory school, my worst problem was having financially poor parents.  This meant that my lunch would arrive from my school bag contained in an old margarine tub, where as every single one of my compatriots would have the blown plastic thermos flask and lunch box adorned with  images of superman or similar.   I would have spam, or luncheon meat, and they would have jam or chocolate paste, or ham and cheese.  As I got closer to puberty, things began to change.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Firstly, I became lonelier than I was earlier in life.  I also experienced difficulty resolving the oedipal complex, and constantly battled with my mother.  I was sent to boarding school for my last term at primary school and the first two terms of secondary school.  I was a weekly boarder, so I returned home at the week ends.  I did so, with huge sets of bruises running down my arms, the consequence of the eldest boys at the boarding school approaching 18 just as punks, skins and mods were battling out the consequences of the second world war that was coursing through their culture.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">At Victoria College secondary school, I was entirely alone.  I had friends, including some who lived near me, but in the playground at break and lunchtime, I spend most of my time moving from one clique to another, so as not to be spotted as lonely.  The loneliness, I greatly suspect now, was due to the fact that I presented a different hormonal profile, as a consequence of being on the receiving end of sexual molestation by a male.  As I stated earlier, there are many fallacious beliefs circulating about victims of sexual abuse, one of which is that I must necessarily be homosexual, having ‘imprinted’ at a sensitive age.  That is utter nonsense.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Our sexuality is something that we can choose, at least the majority of us.  Those who find themselves certainly and reportedly unchangeably homosexual from a young age, are those who have a dominant hormonal shape in the household politic that is female, whether it is a mother or a sister.  There is a gene for sensitivity, in effect, also, which is actually the set of genes that specify relative organ shape in the body, a consequence of the blending of the genes of their parents.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Some people’s internal organs are more likely to be compressing upon one another in a way that causes an excess of blood to be delivered to the brain under certain emotional conditions, and as a child is more likely to cry, or shed tears at the least.  If this is spotted, peer pressure can be pressed into action and convince the child that they are less than male.  There are others who shed tears because of some traumatic incident other than CSA, and there was me, who cried at television adverts even up until the age of 16 or 17, because my brain was so overloaded with attentional constructs being kept alive by relationship to traumatic cycle, that the extra blood was too much, and the salt had to be removed by crying.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I was not any more sensitive, really, than others, perhaps a little secretly, but I don’t think so.  I certainly didn’t ‘imprint’ on men, as a consequence of CSA.  The notion of imprinting has been discarded in modern psychology anyway, but most likely probably continues in the right wing underclass of individuals who couldn’t afford a university education, and who have resulted in becoming vigilantes.  They, to some extent, inherit the theorising of their parent’s generation, theories that are wildly out of date now.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">What I did have, though, was a slightly different hormonal shape to other boys in the playground, and this meant that they had to work harder to successfully process me cognitively.  I make this assumption, based on the fact that I went to a co-educational school at the age of 16 and, surrounded by adolescent young adult females, my hormonal shape recovered, and I became a confident young adult.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The result was that I spent the better part of my early secondary education completely alone.  When I did have friends, it was not always easy to keep up with them.  The attentional deficit stimulated by the CSA was particularly prevalent when a male teacher (and with one exception all the teachers were male) was present, a consequence of isomorphy between the rapist who, as an adult male, inserted things into me, and the teacher who inserted knowledge into me.  I became a classroom clown as a strategy to deal with the attentional deficit, and distracted others to the point that I was shown the door and asked to leave the public school as I approached GCSE age, at about 14 years old.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Also, when I was in the playground, my friends would occasionally play card tricks.  If I was chosen to be on the receiving end of the trick, I would be asked to remember the card, whilst the ‘magician’ sorted through the deck in preparation for revealing my ‘card’.  Almost without fail, I was unable to remember the card.  This was again due to an attentional deficit as a result of experiencing PTSD.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">At about the age of 11, I had several friends who lived near me, some of whom were at Victoria College with me, and one who had gone to boarding school in the UK.  When he returned in the summer holidays, we would sit together whilst the dragon 32 computer was played.  I recall fondling myself rather continuously, which again is something that could be misconstrued.  Whilst it is quite common at that age, I suspect, for the occasional feel, I did it quite continuously.  The reason that I did, was not sexual, but was because I had this ongoing attentional deficit that left my brain ‘tired’, and when fondling, my attentional system suddenly had a direction, which meant that it could relax and become more automatic.  However, it can’t have looked too good in the memories of my friends, when they were later assessing me.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The abuse continued until I plucked up the courage to say ‘no more’.  I was about 16 at the time.  This must seem old to some people, I guess, but when the abuser arrived at my house, as soon as he got me alone, he would start to make advances, and I would disappear into a fugue state.  I would be able to see and respond, but I remained impassionate, and did not respond emotively at all.  It was like I was an artists dummy, and he would move me into poses and begin.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">When I went to the co-educational secondary school, at around the age of 14, I found my hormonal situation recovering due to the presence of females my age.  For a few years, whilst at that school age, I led a relatively normal life.  It wasn’t until I had left that school, and started at another to retake my GCSEs when I was 17 that I first told anyone about what had happened to me.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">So, from my late teens onwards, I experienced the consequences of being targeted by vigilantes.  The entire decade of my twenties was characterised by just about every experience of mental health issue in the book, all of it a consequence of being delibidinised.  As I experienced each mental health issue, I found myself being negotiated further and further into the category of ‘unsuitable to be a parent’, that was literally, a group of bullies who had discovered a raison d’etre for their grotesque desire to catharcise their stress in the form of aggression against some other.  Their opposite, or at least it seemed to them, I suspect, was a person who lacked motivation,  such as a person experiencing depression.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Eventually, whilst I was at university, after I had attempted suicide, and before I had had EMDR, I found a web page of a group called HAVOCA.  It sounds like something from the ‘Man from Uncle’, but it is an acronym for ‘Helping Adult Victims of Child Abuse’.  This web page detailed what symptoms to look for when identifying potential abusers.  The list of symptoms was simply that of a depressive.  The list of symptoms was taken down eventually, and this was back in 2004.  Now the HAVOCA group has matured quite sensibly by a first glance at its current website, havoca.org, which contains advice, forums, book reviews and other aids to survivors of sexual abuse.  So, over the last twenty years, there have been changes to how the subject is dealt with, but the vigilantes continue to engage in delibidinisation of victims, at least that is my experience.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">I know more than a few people who have come off badly at the hands of these vigilantes.  I personally wonder if the vigilantes are not, as a group, able to trace their family history back to fighting families of Britain, when we still had a standing army, and before we had a professional one.  Their immediate instinct has been to hunt the aggressor, armed with that incorrect notion, that the abused abuse.  I found my name was on some list or other, and at any time I tried to go to a pub, my drink would be spiked, within a few weeks of regularly drinking there.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The proper conduct, with regards to dealing with the CSA situation, in my opinion, is to know and understand the symptoms of child sexual abuse, well enough to be able to identify potential victims.  All teachers should receive a training.  False positive identification can be handled by making sure that before any intervention occurs, the child is shadowed, investigated, to demonstrate that it is a reality.  In my experience, many of the symptoms of mental health issue that are indicative of unresolved issues concerning child sexual abuse, can be present for other reasons.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Recently, there has been a type of vigilantism, locally, that is unlike the type of vigilantism that I experienced for so many years.  A local woman, Cheyenne O’Connor, has been engaging in ‘entrapment’, where she has been posing as a 13 year old girl in places where she can be approached by sexual predators.  She then passes the information on to the police.  Whilst I, along with British law, am not a fan of entrapment, it is a reasonably valid approach to the situation, especially when compared to the type of vigilantism that I experienced, where, with no evidence at all, it had been decided that I must be a threat to children, simply because I had spoken out about being abused myself.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">To return to the suggestion of better observation of children for symptoms, the child, once the act has been demonstrated, should be in receipt of EMDR, since the experience of child sexual abuse as a victim, effectively renders the victim into a state of PTSD, and EMDR is non-invasive, and safe as a therapy.  I maintain that it is important to explain how EMDR works, at least with adults, since they need to overcome any lack of trust induced by lack of understanding of the procedure. </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">EMDR is an unusual technique, since it does not require the individual to take some medication, and nor should the individual ‘confess’ in the form of some talking cure. Some explanation of how it works might be useful in the case of children, but ultimately, if EMDR is working properly, it shouldn’t require explanation.  I encourage explanation, as part of the therapy, simply to add that potential placebo effect that is a consequence of trust of therapist.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Markers may exist within children who are experiencing CSA (child sexual abuse).  The presence of these markers can only inform about the potential presence of trauma, it should be noted.  They cannot identify the type of trauma, specifically. It is a subject that requires research.   I suspect that, like myself, many victims of CSA, particularly where felatio has been forced upon them, do not brush their teeth, the isomorphic similarity to a tooth brush and tooth paste, being so powerful as to put off the child from brushing their teeth.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Other markers for trauma might be based upon observing for the consequences of traumatic cycles, neural biases that reawaken themselves as they resolve.  Behaviours that go round and round, repeating over and over again, may well be a normal part of childhood learning.  There may be some significant difference between normal childhood learning and the type of circular, repeating behaviour of children who have been experiencing trauma.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">Another marker that might be observable in children who are experiencing CSA, is that the child no longer shows their teeth when smiling.  This is not necessarily specific to CSA, and may be present for some other reason.  For example, I have a friend who has parted with her boyfriend of many years, and started a relationship with a different man, and her young daughter has stopped showing her teeth when smiling.  My point is that it might be simply because the daughter has been exposed to the adult theme of relationships, through the loss of her father figure and the gaining of a new one.  It may well be a consequence of a type of existential depression.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">In adults with distal trauma due to CSA, the same potential for false positive identification occurs.  Serious distal trauma can lead to brief or even prolonged attentional fugues, where the experience of distal PTSD leads to the person experiencing an interruption of their normal attentional process, and they will suddenly be observed to be staring into space, with a glazed over expression.  Also, adults with distal PTSD often have shadows under their eyes, probably due to interruptions to REM sleep, by an unresolvable neural complex underlying some PTSD traumatic recollection.  The neural complex never sublimates properly, and its continuous presence leads to observable consequences of PTSD related stress.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">In appendix B on criminal uses of materialist psychology, I discussed the use of targeted ECT.  This could be used, potentially successfully, on the child abuser, but I suspect that it will prove to be the case, that the abusers, may have experienced that traumatic self-accusation, and thus may be treatable, to some extent, with EMDR.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">The creation of a society that has a mature approach to the situation, which is to explain the process of traumatic self-accusation, automatic erectile behaviour and other issues that might lead to continuous rumination and eventual rationalisation of criminal behaviour, as well as to provide a caring, supportive and safe environment for those who are experiencing the early signs of potential paedophilia, is an action that needs to be taken, since every base must be covered, since the consequences for the individual of being sexually abused, is potentially a lifetime of the mental health consequences of a specific type of attentional deficit, that of distal PTSD.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent">I have described in the course of writing this book, that we are effectively immortal. It is this reason that I find most likely when describing the following experience.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">One day, in about 2011, I left my flat and walked towards the sea front, only to discover that the park, near where I live, called People’s park, had suddenly sprouted a line of trees around its outer edge.  I had lived in the area for roughly 5 years by that time, and the park had never had trees around its edge before.  These were mature trees though, and showed no signs of having been planted overnight.   A few weeks later, perhaps a month, and suddenly there were two rows of trees.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I had experienced some phenomena that I couldn’t explain without recourse to some dimensional trickery before.  Early in the period following the end of 2009, when the interrogation started, I found myself at my mother’s house, where I engaged with my mother in conversation about the rather untidy nature, from the point of view of feng shui perspective, of her growing rose and hydrangea bushes, at the front of her house. She agreed to cut them back, and then, when I came to visit the next time, she had cut them back, and replanted.  The following week, when I returned, it was back to the way in which it had been before she cut it.  It can’t have been faked.  I reached out and touched the plants, and so they were certainly in existence in that cut shape, before returning to their old form, which I also touched.   Touch should imply that the forms that are touched are certainly in existence, a pragmatic resolution to the cogito which I prefer to hold.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I had other experiences like this, where the only motorway in Jersey, a three mile stretch of road with two lanes, called Victoria Avenue, was tarmacked in its entirety.  I watched as over a three week period, it was tarmacked, then returned to its original state, and then tarmacked again.  I saw buildings ‘move’, although it is more likely that I was moving, most probably by dying.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Then, as if this wasn’t enough, the shape of the major continents of the planet changed, with America becoming reminiscent, in its shape, of a dragon putting a finger to its mouth.  Other continents became shaped differently, including Ireland which became the shape of an owl with its wings outstretched, after I described the fact, thinking out loud in my room, that Jesus wouldn’t wear a symbol of the cross and is far more likely to wear an owl, the symbol of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom. I also pointed to the fact that the Irish were more likely to hunt with birds given the amount of moors that they lived with, almost in the same breath as I described the thing about Minerva.  As I did so, the shape of Ireland changed into this owl shape.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, I am of the opinion, that I might have died at that moment, or otherwise moved dimension.  However, I think that it is possible to train the brain, with targeted ECT or similar into seeing a particular shape, when presented with some stimulus.  In my case I subconsciously see the shape of a world map, and the painful training of my brain leaves me consciously experiencing the shape of the adjusted continents.  The changes accompanied, or rather followed, that period of three weeks in January 2010, when all the earthquakes and volcanoes were occurring, and the weather was at least 35 degrees without there being a cloud in the sky.  </p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I think it likely that, in 2005, when I went to Britain, following the point at which I discovered the bronchodilator being used, I was caught, and immersed in a bath full of ice cubes in order to try and train me to kill my mother, to tie up any ‘loose ends’, following my proof of the bronchodilator to my mother.  When that training was triggered, I found myself experiencing, in 2005, the most powerfully terrible cold, freezing to the bone, even though I was standing in front of a halogen heater.  I knew then that I couldn’t feel the heater because the cold was being constructed by my mind, but I wasn’t entirely aware at the time that the thieves, using their fascist tools, had discovered that targetted ECT could be used to condition into a person, an unfolding sotto voce, or that that same targetted ECT could  be used to make a person forget some episode, of torture, for example, in this case.  So, I couldn’t recall being immersed in a bathtub of ice cubes, but it was the most likely cause of that feeling.  Knowing that the cold was constructed by my mind, I suspected nefarious hypnosis, and that allowed me sufficient detachment to argue with the sotto voce, as it unravelled, which allowed me to prevent it from convincing me to kill my mother.  I made sure to leave signs of what had happened, scraping a mark into her bedroom door, and then waiting for the police, because I feared for her safety, as I had never experienced a situation like it before.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">In 2010 from January the third, there was a period of three weeks of hot weather, which I now suspect to be the obverse of the unwinding catharsis of the experience of being immersed in a bathtub full of ice cubes.  Had I not understood a sufficient amount of psychology to know that the cold that I experienced in 2005 at my mother’s house, before I moved out, was an internal consequence of memory, the pain would probably have stimulated me to internalise the sotto voce and kill my mother.  However, I didn’t, managing to argue with the sotto voce, and was satisfied that she had taken out an injunction, to stop me from returning.  During the three weeks of hot weather, I was exposed to a conditioned sotto voce, that sought to encourage me to experience the hot weather as some religious experience.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">That three weeks was certainly weird.  But then the trees showed up, and the shape of the continents changed and that was even weirder.  In either case, I was left feeling as though I am from another planet, a sort of existential loneliness.  However, my explanation of immortality, leaves the possibility that I am standing in a different dimension to the one that I was on ten years ago.  This is further supported, perhaps, by an inexplicable experience that I had towards the end of 2009, just before the hot weather began.  I was sitting out in my car, in the carpark, in front of the apartment block in which I live, when all of the lights of the building, and the residential tower block next door started flashing on and off in no particular order.  There was no rhythm or pattern to the lights turning on and off, that I could detect.  The experience looked a little like that presentation of patterns in light panels that is shown at the end of the film ‘Close encounters <span style="font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px">of</span> a third kind’.  I could not find any explanation for it, other than perhaps I was dying as I was sitting in the carpark, flitting through worlds where different configurations of lights were on at that time.  However there may well be some more prosaic explanation for the phenomenon.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">I will try and draw the original shape of the continents, that existed for me for all of my life, until 2010, below in figure 12.  If you are experiencing that original map, now, then please let me know.  If no one is then I am certainly on another planet, although actually it is effectively the same planet, just in the next dimension.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">My point is, that it doesn’t really matter, I suppose.  Its certainly a weird experience though, but no matter where I live, I prefer to live with justice, than without, and the power wielded by some fascists and the thieves that are using them, in the form of targeted ECT, used to condition responses and sets of responses, even entire sotto voce narratives or conversational exchanges between two people, let alone the fact that that targeted ECT can be used to make someone forget some event, such as torture or training with that targeted ECT, is powerful enough to leave me concerned for any chance of real freedom in this world, having certainly witnessed evidence of the major politicians, certainly of the western world, falling to this technique.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">So, as the left wing of Europe are billed as people who wish everything to be written down, clearly, including all political values, so becoming champions of ‘accountability’, the right wing are their opposite, believing in unwritten agreements, which they authorise by rationalising that it evidences ‘trust’.  As political union in Europe is created, the overarching isomorph of political power super-ordinate to political union of Europe, which is the papacy, becomes a bias on political expectations, and the right wing are promoted, since they ‘feel’ like the correct answer, as their unwritten agreements are acts of ‘trust’ and of ‘faith’.  With this politically polarised reality emergent, its extremes are felt, and they, co-incidentally enough (due to the thieves propagating them), are the ones armed with the targeted ECT techniques.  That targeted ECT must leave ‘markers’ i.e. physiologically noticeable changes, and it is an absolute priority that those markers are found and a simple, self administrable test is devised and circulated.<br /></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">During the hot three weeks of weather, in 2010, I drove up to Scotland, in order to find out if there really was evidence of the ash being dropped from the Icelandic volcano.  I got there, and found no evidence of ash, nor anyone who remembered ash, despite the newspapers in the south of the country, and in Jersey, suggesting it was a serious problem.  The volcanoes and earthquakes that happened then, along with the hot weather was fashioned to suggest to me that some nuclear war had happened, and that that was the fate of the last planet that I had stood upon.  In a world of such accomplished liars, how could I know?</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent">Anyway, I shall leave you with my drawing, from memory, of the world on which I lived for the greater majority of my life, until 2010.  Weird.</p>

      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:18.666668px"><span style="font-size:14.0px">As I was speaking in my room, in 2010, I mentioned that Jesus wouldn’t have worn the symbol of a cross, but would have worn the symbol of Minerva, and, having been discussing the unification of Ireland, and the distinct possibility that the Irish might be arriving at a time when, as Christians, they can live next to one another in peace, despite their differences, and the map changed at about the same time, to display Ireland with its coastline altered, so that it would resemble an owl, which it does in the new world map, the second one.  I was complaining about having been libidinally adjusted, and Scandinavia turned into the shape presented in the second image, which I perceive in Atlases currently.  It looks rather like a drooping prick and balls.</span></p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:14.0px">I also complained about the nuclear war, and the fact I was being silenced to stop anyone from understanding that the American intelligence agency had created some falsified events that led to the war of 2010, which I perceived as the plethora of volcanoes and earthquakes at the time.  America then changed into the image of a dragon, wings outstretched behind it, westwards, with New Foundland changed to present itself as a finger, held up to the mouth of a dragon.  I cannot know if these images are certainly real, in the sense that the world map present in my field of vision currently, is an accurate depiction of the outline and surface of continents, and that I have ‘moved’ dimension, or that I have simply been electrocuted with targeted ECT, to the extent that whenever my subconscious mind perceives a world map, the electrocution conditioning has resulted in the construction of this image that I now see, the second one.  It is entirely possible that that is the case, both from the point of view of neuropsychology, and from the point of view of being a victim of some thieves, who have been keen to try and ‘derealise’ me, to move me away from being perceived as normal, and into some category of messianic delusion. I understand from psychology that the person recalls autobiographical data about a person, before they recall the image of that person’s face, and I suspect that this result has lead to the capacity of the thieves to fake to the individual that they have ‘moved to a different planet’, the ‘autobiographical’ knowledge of the world being the trigger to construct the image of that world’s face.</p>
      <p class="Firstlineindent" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-indent:0;font-family:NimbusRomNo9L;font-weight:normal;font-size:14.0px">In the new world, the current map that I perceive, the second one, examine the labrador coast.  There is an island, just above the head of the dragon, which shows an upside down dog, perhaps in reference to a smutty act that the thieves put me through as an act of discreditation, later on in my life.  Greenland, looks like the head of that Rastafarian Lion that one sees depicted, at least if one squints…</p>
