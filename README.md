**'The material psychology of consciousness, notes and observations for further research'.**

This repository contains the complete text to my book, 'The material psychology of consciousness, notes and observations for further research'.

The book is published, here on github, so that it can be edited openly, adding or subtracting information, through constructive discussion and provision of research.

The book is currently research free, as I haven't had access to a university library and also felt that I should put down my insights first, and then seek to find supporting research or engage in some empirical program of research afterwards.

It can be forked, pull requests can be made, merge requests can also be made.  If the issues tracker isn't sufficiently powerful to empower quality discussion, then I will create a forum to do so.

The book, including all of its insights, is published under a modified version of the creative commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license.  The modification relates to the use of the ideas contained herein, and specifies as precisely and as openly as possible, that should any of the insights contained herein, or any variant derived from them, be used for harming others, with specific reference to weaponisation, or harming the eco-system in some way, then all rights to use the textual content in anyway are revoked.

The book presents a materialist model of neuro-physisology, that presents a computationally realisable model of human consciousness, and, in doing so, examines the consequences for psychological and physical health.
It also presents a model of consciousness that can be realised in a machine form as well as examining, in a rationalist model, what happens 'after death'.  Some insights into the way in which a materialist psychological analysis can inform models of economics is also presented.

There are five appendices, the first being the inclusion of an earlier essay, that I wrote in 2004, regarding PTSD.  The second is concerning a model set of instructions to accompany EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprogramming).  The third is a call for help, regarding the actions of some criminals who have been attacking academics and, using the mental hospital amongst other techniques to discredit and isolate them, then steal their intellectual insights.  The fourth appendix is on the subject of the consequences of Child Sexual Abuse as seen from the point of view of survivor with a degree in psychology, ie me.
The final appendix illustrates some extra detail.

So, since there are certainly areas that are contentious, please feel free to fork the book.  A simple but precise versioning scheme should be sufficient to differentiate this book from any future, forked version.

If you wish to add something to this root version, then please make a pull request, and then a merge request later.  I will review any changes, additions etc etc. and if I see any issues I will open it up for discussion in the issues tracker or a forum, should I create one.

I hope that this format allows the greatest, technologically empowered, method of delineating ideas in a sensible format.  I publish the book for free, partly since it is not supported by research, and so, is a matter of personal opinion currently.  However, I publish it for free mostly because it concerns the subject of health, and all health should be free, as I discuss in the foreword.

Also, all ideas should be free.  The patent system, apart from serving to prevent the free delineation of ideas, allows thieves to attack academics and steal their insights, consigning them to some mental hospital when they have finished and then selling their ideas.  It is more than just a preventative safety measure though.  

**Ideas should always be freely available.**
